"Socket.IO client-side library from your Socket.IO server" refers to the fact that Socket.IO provides both server-side and client-side
libraries, and they work together to establish real-time, bi-directional communication between a server and web clients.

  
Socket.IO is designed to work in two parts:

Server-side: The server-side code is typically run using Node.js. This part manages connections, handles incoming events from 
clients, and broadcasts or emits events to all or specific clients.

Client-side: The client-side code (JavaScript running in the browser) listens to events sent by the server and can also emit
events to the server (e.g., sending messages or notifying when a user connects/disconnects).



Serving the Client-Side Library from the Server:

When you include this line in your HTML:

<script src="http://localhost:3000/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>

This loads the client-side Socket.IO library directly from the Socket.IO server running on your machine at http://localhost:3000.

Why from the server? When the server starts with Socket.IO, it automatically serves the necessary client-side JavaScript library (socket.io.js) 
that knows how to communicate with the server. This ensures that the version of the client-side library matches the version 
of the server-side library, preventing potential compatibility issues.

  
Convenience and Compatibility:

Instead of manually downloading and including the Socket.IO client library in your project, you can load it directly from the Socket.IO server,
ensuring it's always compatible with the server version you're running.
The Socket.IO server automatically exposes the client-side library at the /socket.io/socket.io.js path, making it simple to use.


  
How it Works:
When you add this script to your HTML:
<script src="http://localhost:3000/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>

The browser makes a request to http://localhost:3000/socket.io/socket.io.js.

The Socket.IO server responds with the client-side JavaScript file (socket.io.js).

This client-side library helps the browser establish a connection with the Socket.IO server and enables communication u
sing events (like connection, disconnect, chat-message, etc.).
