Component Mounting and Unmounting:

Mounting: When a component is rendered for the first time (i.e., it's being added to the DOM), it is considered "mounted." React 
performs any side effects (like calling useEffect) at this point.

Unmounting: When a component is removed from the DOM (e.g., if it is no longer part of the component tree), it is considered 
"unmounted." React cleans up any side effects or event listeners associated with the component.



Re-renders:

A re-render occurs when a component's state or props change. React updates the component and re-renders it, but this doesn't necessarily 
mean that the component is unmounted and mounted again. React simply updates the DOM with the new state/props.


In the Context of useEffect:

When you use useEffect with an empty dependency array ([]), React runs the effect only once, when the component first mounts.

Initial Mount: The effect runs for the first time when the component is added to the DOM.

Subsequent Re-renders: After that, any subsequent re-renders (due to state or props changes) won't trigger the effect again. The effect is not 
re-executed unless the component is unmounted and mounted again 
(e.g., if the component is removed from the DOM and then re-added).

Example:
Imagine a component that fetches data when it is mounted, and you want to ensure it only happens once, even if the component re-renders:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const DataFetcher = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Fetching data...");
    // Simulate a fetch operation
    setData("Some data");
  }, []); // Empty dependency array, will run only once

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data: {data}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};


First Mount: When DataFetcher is first rendered, React calls useEffect and logs "Fetching data...". 
The setData function updates the data state.

Subsequent Re-renders: If the component re-renders due to state or props updates, the useEffect hook won't run again because
it has an empty dependency array []. The effect will run only once, on the first mount.

Unmounting and Re-mounting: If the DataFetcher component is removed from the DOM (unmounted) and then re-rendered
(mounted again), the useEffect hook will run again because the component is being mounted from scratch.



What Does This Mean for Re-renders?

Re-renders (due to state or props changes) do not trigger the useEffect hook if it has an empty dependency array. This is because Reac
t does not treat re-renders as remounts of the component.

If the component is unmounted (removed from the DOM) and mounted again (re-rendered in the DOM), the effect will run again
as if itâ€™s being executed for the first time.

Example of Unmounting and Re-mounting:
If you conditionally render a component, like this:

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>Toggle Component</button>
      {show && <DataFetcher />}
    </div>
  );
};


First Mount: When DataFetcher is first rendered, it will run the useEffect and log "Fetching data...".

Re-rendering ParentComponent: If you click the button and re-render ParentComponent, the DataFetcher component will not re-run its useEffect.

Unmounting DataFetcher: If you click the button again to hide the DataFetcher (unmount it), and then click it back to show it again (re-mount it),
the useEffect hook will run again because DataFetcher is mounted from scratch.


In summary:

Re-renders (state or props changes) do not re-trigger the useEffect when using an empty dependency array [].
The effect only re-runs if the component is unmounted and then mounted again (i.e., when it is removed from the DOM and re-added).
