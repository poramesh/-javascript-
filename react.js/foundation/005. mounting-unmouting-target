Component Mounting and Unmounting:

Mounting: When a component is rendered for the first time (i.e., it's being added to the DOM), it is considered "mounted." React 
performs any side effects (like calling useEffect) at this point.

Unmounting: When a component is removed from the DOM (e.g., if it is no longer part of the component tree), it is considered 
"unmounted." React cleans up any side effects or event listeners associated with the component.



Re-renders:

A re-render occurs when a component's state or props change. React updates the component and re-renders it, but this doesn't necessarily 
mean that the component is unmounted and mounted again. React simply updates the DOM with the new state/props.


In the Context of useEffect:

When you use useEffect with an empty dependency array ([]), React runs the effect only once, when the component first mounts.

Initial Mount: The effect runs for the first time when the component is added to the DOM.

Subsequent Re-renders: After that, any subsequent re-renders (due to state or props changes) won't trigger the effect again. The effect is not 
re-executed unless the component is unmounted and mounted again 
(e.g., if the component is removed from the DOM and then re-added).

Example:
Imagine a component that fetches data when it is mounted, and you want to ensure it only happens once, even if the component re-renders:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const DataFetcher = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Fetching data...");
    // Simulate a fetch operation
    setData("Some data");
  }, []); // Empty dependency array, will run only once

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Data: {data}</h1>
    </div>
  );
};


First Mount: When DataFetcher is first rendered, React calls useEffect and logs "Fetching data...". 
The setData function updates the data state.

Subsequent Re-renders: If the component re-renders due to state or props updates, the useEffect hook won't run again because
it has an empty dependency array []. The effect will run only once, on the first mount.

Unmounting and Re-mounting: If the DataFetcher component is removed from the DOM (unmounted) and then re-rendered
(mounted again), the useEffect hook will run again because the component is being mounted from scratch.



What Does This Mean for Re-renders?

Re-renders (due to state or props changes) do not trigger the useEffect hook if it has an empty dependency array. This is because Reac
t does not treat re-renders as remounts of the component.

If the component is unmounted (removed from the DOM) and mounted again (re-rendered in the DOM), the effect will run again
as if it’s being executed for the first time.

Example of Unmounting and Re-mounting:
If you conditionally render a component, like this:

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>Toggle Component</button>
      {show && <DataFetcher />}
    </div>
  );
};


First Mount: When DataFetcher is first rendered, it will run the useEffect and log "Fetching data...".

Re-rendering ParentComponent: If you click the button and re-render ParentComponent, the DataFetcher component will not re-run its useEffect.

Unmounting DataFetcher: If you click the button again to hide the DataFetcher (unmount it), and then click it back to show it again (re-mount it),
the useEffect hook will run again because DataFetcher is mounted from scratch.


In summary:

Re-renders (state or props changes) do not re-trigger the useEffect when using an empty dependency array [].
The effect only re-runs if the component is unmounted and then mounted again (i.e., when it is removed from the DOM and re-added).







what does target could mean?

In JavaScript, particularly in the context of event handling, target refers to the DOM element that triggered the event. It is a property of 
the event object (e.target) and provides a reference to the HTML element where the event occurred.

Key Points About target


What It Represents:
It refers to the actual element that initiated the event. For example, if a button is clicked, target will be the button element.

Why It’s Useful:
It allows you to access and interact with the triggering element's properties (e.g., value, checked, id, className).

Common Properties Accessed via target:

value: For text inputs, this retrieves the current text.
checked: For checkboxes or radio buttons, this indicates whether the element is checked.
id: The ID of the element.
name: The name attribute of the element.
type: The type of the input element (e.g., text, checkbox).

Example Scenarios
1. For a Text Input:

<input
  type="text"
  onChange={(e) => console.log(e.target.value)}
/>
When the user types in the input box, e.target.value logs the text entered.

2. For a Checkbox:

<input
  type="checkbox"
  onChange={(e) => console.log(e.target.checked)}
/>

When the checkbox is checked or unchecked, e.target.checked logs true or false.

3. Accessing Other Attributes:

<button id="saveButton" onClick={(e) => console.log(e.target.id)}>
  Save
</button>

When the button is clicked, e.target.id logs "saveButton".

Relationship Between target and currentTarget

target: Refers to the element that actually triggered the event (could be a child element).
currentTarget: Refers to the element to which the event handler is attached.

Example:

<div onClick={(e) => console.log('target:', e.target, 'currentTarget:', e.currentTarget)}>
  <button>Click Me</button>
</div>

If the button is clicked:
e.target: Refers to the <button> element.
e.currentTarget: Refers to the <div> element because the event handler is attached to the <div>.
