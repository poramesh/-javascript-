JavaScript Comparison Operators
_____________________
Equality Operators
_________________
Equality (==)

The equality operator is a binary operator that compares two operands, returning true if they are deemed to be equal. It works by converting 
the operands if they are not of the same type, then applying strict comparison. If both operands are primitive types, 
it will compare their values (i.e., 1 == 1 evaluates to true). If both operands are objects, then JavaScript compares their internal references; 
this means it checks to see if both operands point to the same object (i.e., location) in memory. 



In JavaScript, the == operator performs type coercion before comparing values. Here's the explanation for each of the console log statements:


console.log(1 == 1); //true (Both values are numbers and equal, so the result is true.)
console.log(1 == "1"); //true (The string "1" is coerced to the number 1, and 1 equals 1, so the result is true.)
console.log('1' == 1); //true (Similar to the previous example, the string '1' is coerced to the number 1, resulting in true.)
console.log(0 == false); //true (The boolean false is coerced to the number 0, so 0 equals 0, resulting in true.)
console.log(0 == null); //false (null is only equal to undefined when using == and does not coerce to any other value, so the result is false.)
console.log(0 == undefined); //false (Similar to the previous case, undefined does not coerce to 0, resulting in false.)
console.log(null == undefined); //true (null and undefined are equal to each other when using ==, so the result is true.)

Inequality (!=)

The inequality operator is a binary operator that returns true if the operands are not equal. If the two operands are of different types,
JavaScript attempts to convert the operands to an appropriate type to compare them. If both operands are objects, then JavaScript compares the internal
references to see if they are not equal (i.e., refer to different objects in memory).

console.log(1 != 1); //false
console.log(1 != "1"); //false
console.log('1' != 1); //false
console.log(0 != false); //fasle
console.log(0 != null); //true
console.log(0 != undefined); //true
console.log(null != undefined); //false

comparing objects

we have two references that point to different objects taht look the same:

var1!-var2

var1 ->object in memory

var2 -> object in memory


we have two referenves that point to the same object:

var1==var2

var1------>    
           --->object in memory
var2------>


// This creates a custom object named MyObject
class MyObject {
    // Each object of this type has an attribute named 'magic'
    constructor(magic) {
        this.magic = magic;
    }
    // We'll discuss this syntax in more detail later
}

// Create two objects 
var variable1 = new MyObject(":)");
var variable2 = new MyObject(":)");

// Print the result of an equality comparison
console.log( variable1.magic + " == " + variable2.magic
            + " evaluates to "
            + (variable1 == variable2)
            );

// Set variable1 to reference the same object as variable2
variable1 = variable2;
// Print the result of an equality comparison
console.log( variable1.magic + " == " + variable2.magic
            + " evaluates to "
            + (variable1 == variable2)
            );

o/p
:) == :) evaluates to false
:) == :) evaluates to true

Identity or Strict Equality (===)

The identity operator returns true if both of the following conditions are satisfied:
>The operands are strictly equal.
>The operands are of the same type.

console.log(1 === 1); //true
console.log(1 === "1"); //false
console.log('1' === 1); //false
console.log(0 === false); //false
console.log(0 === null); //false
console.log(0 === undefined); //false
console.log(null === undefined); //false

Non-Identity or Strict Inequality (!==)

The non-identity operator returns true if the operands satisfy any of the following conditions:
>The operands are not equal.
>The operands are not of the same type.

console.log(1 !== 1); //false
console.log(1 !== "1"); //true
console.log('1' !== 1); //true
console.log(0 !== false); //true
console.log(0 !== null); //true
console.log(0 !== undefined); //true
console.log(null !== undefined); //true

Relational Operators
______________________

console.log(5 > 5); //false (greator than operator)
console.log(5 >= 5); //true (geater than or equal operator)
console.log(7 < 6); //false (Less than operator)
console.log(4 <= 6); //true (Less Than or Equal Operator (<=))

_________________
Logical Operators
__________________

console.log((5 < 7) && (4 < 4)) //false
console.log((5 < 7) && (4 >= 4)) //true(logical and)
console.log((5 < 7) || (4 < 4))  //true
console.log((5 >= 7) || (4 > 4)) //false (logical or)
console.log(!(2**3)) (logical not) //false (logical not)

_________________________
Short-circuit evaluation
_________________________
As logical expressions are evaluated from left to right, they are tested for possible short-circuit evaluation using the following rules:

false && expression is short-circuit evaluated to false.
true || expression is short-circuit evaluated to true.

function classifyAge(age) {
    /* First, let's check the lower bound on our age range: */
    if (age < 13) {
        return age + " is a child.";
    }
    /* If this condition is checked, we know that age < 13 is false: */
    else if (age < 20) {
        return age + " is a teenager.";
    }
    /* If this condition is checked, we know both of these are false:
    *   age < 13 is false
    *   age < 20 is false
    *  This tells us that either age >= 20 is true, or age is not a number:
    */
    else if (age >= 20){
        return age + " is an adult.";
    }
    /* The input wasn't a number. */
    else {
        return "Your input must be an integer.";
    }
}

function main(input) {
    console.log(classifyAge(input));
}
______________
Falsy values
______________

The following six values are known as Falsy values, meaning they evaluate to false:

false
undefined
null
0
NaN
"" (i.e., the empty string)

All other values, including all objects, evaluate to true when used as the condition in a conditional statement.

var a = true;
var b = new Boolean(false);
var c = "";

console.log(a); //true
console.log(b); //[Boolean(false)]
console.log("\"" + c + "\""); ""

if (a) {
    console.log("Hello from a");  //hello from a
}

if (b) {
    console.log("Hello from b"); //hello from b ( Even though b is created with new Boolean(false), objects are truthy in JavaScript. Therefore, 
the condition evaluates to true and "Hello from b" is printed.)
}

if (c) {
    console.log("Hello from c");  (An empty string ("") is falsy in JavaScript. Therefore, the condition evaluates to false, and the else block is executed, printing "c is false".)
}
else {
    console.log("c is false"); //c is false
}

_______________________________
Conditional (Ternary) Operator
__________________________________
The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands,
and it's used as a shortcut for the if statement. 

The basic syntax is: condition ? trueStatement : falseStatement

You can essentially read the ? as the word "then" and the : as the word "else". If
evaluates to true, then trueStatement is executed; else, falseStatement is executed. 


process.stdin.on('data', function (data) {
    main(+(data)); //4
});
/**** Ignore above this line. ****/

function main(input) {
    // The examples below all accomplish the same thing.

    // Example 1:
    input % 2 == 0 ? console.log(input + " is EVEN") : console.log(input + " is ODD"); //4 is even

    // Example 2:
    console.log( input + " is " + ((input % 2 == 0) ? "EVEN" : "ODD")); // 4 is Even

    // Example 3:
    var parity = input % 2 == 0 ? "EVEN" : "ODD"; 
    console.log(input + " is " + parity); //4 is EVEN
} 

_____________________________
Switch conditional statements
______________________________

A switch statement allows a program to evaluate an expression by attempting to match the expression's value to a case label. If a match is found, the
program jumps to the statement(s) associated with the matched label and continues executing at that point. Note that execution will continue 
sequentially through all the statements starting at the jump point unless there is a call to break;, which exits the switch statement. A switch statement looks like this:

switch (expression) {
    case label1:
        statement1;
        break;
    case label2:
        statement2;
        break;
    case label3:
        statement3;
        statement4;
        break;
    default:
        statement;
}

the default clause
By convention, the default clause is always listed last. This is because the statements are checked sequentially, so you run into the following issues if you use the default label in 
an earlier clause

The break; Statement
The break statement is optional, but you'll typically see one at the end of each case clause to ensure that the program breaks out of the switch statement once 
the statements associated with a matched case are executed. Once the flow of execution hits break;, it exits the switch statement and continues executing at the next line
following the end of the switch statement; if the break statement is omitted, the program continues executing the next statement in the switch statement â€” 
even if its case label doesn't match .

Given an integer, n, such that 0<n<11 , do the following:
If n is equal to 2, print A.
If n is equal to 3, print B.
If n is equal to 4, print C.
If n is equal to 5, print D
For all the other values of n, print E.

Input Format
A single integer denoting n.

var input = "";
process.stdin.on('data', function (data) {
    input = data;
    switchDemo();
});
function readLine() { return input; }
/**** Ignore above this line. ****/

function switchDemo() {
    var n = parseInt(readLine());

    switch (n) {
        case 2:
            console.log("A");
            break;
        case 3:
            console.log("B");
            break;
        case 4:
            console.log("C");
            break;
        case 5:
            console.log("D");
            break;
        default:
            console.log("E");
    }

    console.log("Exited switch.");
}
i/p: 
4
o/p:
C
Exited switch.

if there was no break statment above then it would printed:
C
D
E
Exited switch

cause it stops executing the logic.

In a switch statement, once a case matches, execution continues until a break statement is encountered or the end of the switch block is reached. 
This is known as the "fall-through" behavior. The switch statement does not re-evaluate the condition for each subsequent case after a match is found.
----------

another example where case /code does not parse  as an integer. This means it's evaluated
as an object, where a strict comparison (===) is made comparing the case label to the expression value.

var input = "";
process.stdin.on('data', function (data) {
    input = data;
    switchDemo();
});
function readLine() { return input; }
/**** Ignore above this line. ****/

function switchDemo() {
    // This will read n as an object.
    var n = readLine();

    switch (n) {
        case 2:
            console.log("A");
            break;
        case 3:
            console.log("B");
            break;
        case 4:
            console.log("C");
            break;
        case 5:
            console.log("D");
            break;
        default:
            console.log("E");
    }

    console.log("Exited switch.");

o/p:
E
Exited switch.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________
If 25<score<=20, then grade=A.
If 20<score<=25, then grade=B.
If 15<score<=20, then grade=C.
If 10<score<=15, then grade=D.
If 5<score<=10, then grade=E.
If 0<score<=5, then grade=F.


Input Format
Stub code in the editor reads a single integer denoting score from stdin and passes it to the function.

Constraints
0<=score<=30

Output Format
The function must return the value of grade (i.e., the letter grade) that Julia earned on the exam.

Sample Input 
11

Sample Output 
D

Explanation 0
Because score =11, it satisfies the condition 10<score<=15  (which corresponds to D). Thus, we return D as our answer.
