Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It simplifies interactions with MongoDB by 
providing a structured way to define schemas, validate data, and work with collections in a more "JavaScript-friendly" manner.


Why Learn Mongoose?

Simplifies MongoDB Operations:

With plain MongoDB, you often write raw queries, which can be verbose and error-prone. Mongoose abstracts
many of these details and makes the code more readable.

Example:
Without Mongoose:

db.collection('users').insertOne({ name: 'John', age: 30 });

With Mongoose:

const user = new User({ name: 'John', age: 30 });
user.save();

Schema Definition and Validation:

Mongoose lets you define schemas for your data, enforcing structure and validating fields before data is saved to the database.

Example:
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  age: { type: Number, min: 0 }
});

const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

This ensures your data is always consistent.



Middleware for Logic Automation:

Mongoose allows you to define middleware (hooks) for automating tasks like hashing passwords, logging, or cleaning up data.

Example:
userSchema.pre('save', function (next) {
  this.updatedAt = Date.now();
  next();
});


Relationships and Population:

MongoDB is a NoSQL database, so it doesn't natively support relations like SQL databases. Mongoose provides features like population
to link documents and simulate relationships.

Example:

const postSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  author: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }
});


Active Community and Documentation:

Mongoose is widely used, meaning you'll find plenty of tutorials, libraries, and community support to help you with common tasks.


When Should You Learn Mongoose?
If You Are:
Building applications with Node.js and MongoDB.
Looking for structured and type-safe interaction with MongoDB.
Working on a project where data consistency and schema enforcement are important.

If You Value:
Cleaner code for database operations.
Built-in features for validation, middleware, and querying.
An easier learning curve compared to working with raw MongoDB.

When You Might Skip Mongoose
Small, Simple Projects:

If your project has very few database operations, plain MongoDB queries (mongodb driver) might suffice.

Example:

const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');
const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017');
const db = client.db('mydatabase');
db.collection('users').find({}).toArray();

Need for Maximum Performance:

Mongoose introduces some overhead. For performance-critical applications, using raw MongoDB queries can be faster.
Dynamic or Flexible Schemas:

If your data structure is highly dynamic and doesn't benefit from a strict schema, raw MongoDB might be more suitable.
