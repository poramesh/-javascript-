 Aggregation Pipelines

Aggregation operations allow you to group, sort, perform calculations, analyze data, and much more.
Aggregation pipelines can have one or more "stages". The order of these stages are important. Each stage acts upon the results of the previous stage.

db.posts.aggregate([
  // Stage 1: Only find documents that have more than 1 like
  {
    $match: { likes: { $gt: 1 } }
  },
  // Stage 2: Group documents by category and sum each categories likes
  {
    $group: { _id: "$category", totalLikes: { $sum: "$likes" } }
  }
])


[
  { "_id": 1, "category": "Technology", "likes": 5 },
  { "_id": 2, "category": "Food", "likes": 3 },
  { "_id": 3, "category": "Technology", "likes": 2 },
  { "_id": 4, "category": "Travel", "likes": 1 },
  { "_id": 5, "category": "Food", "likes": 0 },
  { "_id": 6, "category": "Technology", "likes": 7 },
  { "_id": 7, "category": "Travel", "likes": 6 }
]


[
  { "_id": "Technology", "totalLikes": 14 },
  { "_id": "Food", "totalLikes": 3 },
  { "_id": "Travel", "totalLikes": 7 }
]


1. group

db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate(
    [ { $group : { _id : "$property_type" } } ]
)    

This will return the distinct values from the property_type field.
The _id field inside $group is used to define the grouping key. In this case, it is grouping by the field "property_type".


{
  "_id": "12345",
  "name": "Cozy Cottage",
  "property_type": "House",
  "price": 120,
  "bedrooms": 3,
  "bathrooms": 2,
  "location": {
    "address": "123 Maple Street",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "country": "USA"
  },
  "reviews": [
    {
      "reviewer_name": "John",
      "rating": 5,
      "comment": "Amazing place!"
    },
    {
      "reviewer_name": "Jane",
      "rating": 4,
      "comment": "Very comfortable, but a bit noisy."
    }
  ]
}
{
  "_id": "12346",
  "name": "Modern Apartment",
  "property_type": "Apartment",
  "price": 200,
  "bedrooms": 2,
  "bathrooms": 1,
  "location": {
    "address": "456 Oak Avenue",
    "city": "New York",
    "country": "USA"
  },
  "reviews": [...]
}


After running your query, you'd get a result like:

[
  { "_id": "House" },
  { "_id": "Apartment" },
  { "_id": "Villa" }
]


more exmaple:

db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([
    { 
      $group: { 
        _id: { type: "$property_type", city: "$location.city" } 
      } 
    }
])
This query groups documents by both property_type and location.city, so the result will look like:

[
  { "_id": { "type": "House", "city": "San Francisco" } },
  { "_id": { "type": "Apartment", "city": "New York" } },
  { "_id": { "type": "Villa", "city": "Los Angeles" } }
]



why it is _id and how it is different from the object_id

Let's look at how MongoDB processes this.

Original Data:
_id	                      name	     property_type	  price
507f191e810c19729de860ea	Cozy       Cottage	House	  120
507f191e810c19729de860eb	Modern     Apartment	     	200
507f191e810c19729de860ec	Luxury     Villa		        350
507f191e810c19729de860ed	Beachfront House	      	  400

What MongoDB Does:
It looks at the property_type of each document and groups together documents that have the same property_type:

Group 1: All documents with property_type: "House".
Group 2: All documents with property_type: "Apartment".
Group 3: All documents with property_type: "Villa".

So, the result will look like this:
[
  { "_id": "House" },
  { "_id": "Apartment" },
  { "_id": "Villa" }
]
Step 4: What is _id Doing Here?

In this query, _id is not the same as the _id in the original documents.

In the original documents, _id is the unique identifier for each document (like the row number in a table).
But in the $group stage, _id is used to define the "grouping key"—the value by which you want to group the documents.

In your case, you've chosen to group by property_type, so each group in the result will have _id equal to the value of property_type.

_id: "House" means this group contains all the documents where property_type was "House".
_id: "Apartment" means this group contains all the documents where property_type was "Apartment".
_id: "Villa" means this group contains all the documents where property_type was "Villa".


[
  { "_id": 1, "property_type": "Apartment", "price": 100 },
  { "_id": 2, "property_type": "House", "price": 200 },
  { "_id": 3, "property_type": "Apartment", "price": 150 },
  { "_id": 4, "property_type": "House", "price": 250 },
  { "_id": 5, "property_type": "Studio", "price": 80 }
]

[
  { "_id": "Apartment" },
  { "_id": "House" },
  { "_id": "Studio" }
]


Each document in the result contains a distinct property_type as the _id.
No aggregation is being done on the price or any other field — the query only groups by property_type.

What This Query Does:
It finds all the unique values of property_type across all documents in the collection and returns them.
The _id field in each document will hold the value of property_type.


db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$property_type", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
]);

[
  { "_id": "Apartment", "count": 2 },
  { "_id": "House", "count": 2 },
  { "_id": "Studio", "count": 1 }
]

__________________________________________________________________________________________
Aggregation $limit:


This aggregation stage limits the number of documents passed to the next stage.

Example
In this example, we are using the "sample_mflix" database loaded from our sample data in the Intro to Aggregations section.

db.movies.aggregate([ { $limit: 1 } ])

[
  {
    _id: ObjectId("573a1390f29313caabcd4135"),

Aggregation $project


This aggregation stage passes only the specified fields along to the next aggregation stage.
This is the same projection that is used with the find() method.

Example
In this example, we are using the "sample_restaurants" database loaded from our sample data in the Intro to Aggregations section.

db.restaurants.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      "name": 1,
      "cuisine": 1,
      "address": 1
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 5
  }
])

o/p:

[
    {
      _id: ObjectId("5eb3d668b31de5d588f4292a"),
      address: {
        building: '2780',
        coord: [ -73.98241999999999, 40.579505 ],
        street: 'Stillwell Avenue',
        zipcode: '11224'
      },
      cuisine: 'American',
      name: 'Riviera Caterer'
    },
    {
      _id: ObjectId("5eb3d668b31de5d588f4292b"),
      address: {
        building: '7114',
        coord: [ -73.9068506, 40.6199034 ],
        street: 'Avenue U',
        zipcode: '11234'
      },
      cuisine: 'Delicatessen',
      name: "Wilken'S Fine Food"
    },
    {
      _id: ObjectId("5eb3d668b31de5d588f4292c"),
      address: {
        building: '2206',
        coord: [ -74.1377286, 40.6119572 ],
        street: 'Victory Boulevard',
        zipcode: '10314'
      },
      cuisine: 'Jewish/Kosher',
      name: 'Kosher Island'
    },
    {
      _id: ObjectId("5eb3d668b31de5d588f4292d"),
      address: {
        building: '469',
        coord: [ -73.961704, 40.662942 ],
        street: 'Flatbush Avenue',
        zipcode: '11225'
      },
      cuisine: 'Hamburgers',
      name: "Wendy'S"
    },
    {
      _id: ObjectId("5eb3d668b31de5d588f4292e"),
      address: {
        building: '1007',
        coord: [ -73.856077, 40.848447 ],
        street: 'Morris Park Ave',
        zipcode: '10462'
      },
      cuisine: 'Bakery',
      name: 'Morris Park Bake Shop'
    }
  ]


We use a 1 to include a field and 0 to exclude a field.

Note: You cannot use both 0 and 1 in the same object. The only exception is the _id field. You should either specify the fields you would
like to include or the fields you would like to exclude.


_____________________________________________________


Aggregation $sort

this aggregation stage groups sorts all documents in the specified sort order.
Remember that the order of your stages matters. Each stage only acts upon the documents that previous stages provide.

Example
In this example, we are using the "sample_airbnb" database loaded from our sample data in the Intro to Aggregations section.

db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([ 
  { 
    $sort: { "accommodates": -1 } 
  },
  {
    $project: {
      "name": 1,
      "accommodates": 1
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 5
  }
])
This will return the documents sorted in descending order by the accommodates field.
The sort order can be chosen by using 1 or -1. 1 is ascending and -1 is descending.


[
  {
    _id: '19990097',
    name: 'House close to station & direct to opera house....',
    accommodates: 16
  },
  { _id: '19587001', name: 'Kaena O Kekai', accommodates: 16 },
  {
    _id: '20958766',
    name: 'Great Complex of the Cellars',
    accommodates: 16
  },
  {
    _id: '12509339',
    name: 'Barra da Tijuca beach house',
    accommodates: 16
  },
  {
    _id: '20455499',
    name: 'DOWNTOWN VIP MONTREAL ,HIGH END DECOR,GOOD VALUE..',
    accommodates: 16
  }
]


____________________________________________________________

Aggregation $match

This aggregation stage behaves like a find. It will filter documents that match the query provided.
Using $match early in the pipeline can improve performance since it limits the number of documents the next stages must process.

Example:


db.listingsAndReviews.aggregate([ 
  { $match : { property_type : "House" } },
  { $limit: 2 },
  { $project: {
    "name": 1,
    "bedrooms": 1,
    "price": 1
  }}
])


o/p:

[
  {
    _id: '16253247',
    name: 'Gorgeous Remodeled Modern Home w/ Beach Across St.',
    bedrooms: 2,
    price: 194.00
  },
  {
    _id: '18616850',
    name: 'The Paddington Cottage | Sydney Eastern Suburbs',
    bedrooms: 3,
    price: 350.00
  }
]


Aggregation $addFields

This aggregation stage adds new fields to documents.

Example

db.restaurants.aggregate([
  {
    $addFields: {
      avgGrade: { $avg: "$grades.score" }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      "name": 1,
      "avgGrade": 1
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 5
  }
])
This will return the documents along with a new field, avgGrade, which will contain the average of each restaurants

o/p:

[
  {
    _id: ObjectId("5eb3d668b31de5d588f4292a"),
    name: 'Riviera Caterer',
    avgGrade: 9
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId("5eb3d668b31de5d588f4292b"),
    name: "Wilken'S Fine Food",
    avgGrade: 10
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId("5eb3d668b31de5d588f4292c"),
    name: 'Kosher Island',
    avgGrade: 10.5
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId("5eb3d668b31de5d588f4292d"),
    name: "Wendy'S",
    avgGrade: 13.75
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId("5eb3d668b31de5d588f4292e"),
    name: 'Morris Park Bake Shop',
    avgGrade: 8.2
  }
]

The $addFields stage in the MongoDB aggregation pipeline does not modify the original documents in the database. Instead,
it creates a new output for the aggregation result that includes the additional field (in your case, avgGrade).
____________________________


Aggregation $count

This aggregation stage counts the total amount of documents passed from the previous stage.

Example
In this example, we are using the "sample_restaurants" database loaded from our sample data in the Intro to Aggregations section.

db.restaurants.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { "cuisine": "Chinese" }
  },
  {
    $count: "totalChinese"
  }
])
This will return the number of documents at the $count stage as a field called "totalChinese".

[ { totalChinese: 2418 } ]

The result will be a single document with a field named totalChinese, which will contain the count of the matching documents.

Aggregation in MongoDB is a powerful tool used to process and analyze data in a more sophisticated manner than simple queries allow. 
It allows you to transform, filter, and compute data across documents, typically through the aggregation pipeline.


Core Aggregation Stages


[
  { "_id": 1, "customer_id": "A123", "amount": 500, "status": "completed", "category": "electronics", "date": "2024-11-01" },
  { "_id": 2, "customer_id": "A124", "amount": 150, "status": "completed", "category": "clothing", "date": "2024-11-02" },
  { "_id": 3, "customer_id": "A123", "amount": 200, "status": "completed", "category": "electronics", "date": "2024-11-03" },
  { "_id": 4, "customer_id": "A125", "amount": 50, "status": "pending", "category": "groceries", "date": "2024-11-03" },
  { "_id": 5, "customer_id": "A126", "amount": 750, "status": "completed", "category": "electronics", "date": "2024-11-05" },
  { "_id": 6, "customer_id": "A124", "amount": 100, "status": "completed", "category": "clothing", "date": "2024-11-06" },
  { "_id": 7, "customer_id": "A127", "amount": 300, "status": "completed", "category": "home", "date": "2024-11-07" },
  { "_id": 8, "customer_id": "A123", "amount": 700, "status": "completed", "category": "electronics", "date": "2024-11-08" }
]

$match:

Filters the documents to pass only those that match the given condition. It’s similar to a find query but used in aggregation pipelines.

Example:
db.collection.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } }
]);
This would only pass documents with a status of "completed".

[
  { "_id": 1, "customer_id": "A123", "amount": 500, "status": "completed", "category": "electronics", "date": "2024-11-01" },
  { "_id": 2, "customer_id": "A124", "amount": 150, "status": "completed", "category": "clothing", "date": "2024-11-02" },
  { "_id": 3, "customer_id": "A123", "amount": 200, "status": "completed", "category": "electronics", "date": "2024-11-03" },
  { "_id": 5, "customer_id": "A126", "amount": 750, "status": "completed", "category": "electronics", "date": "2024-11-05" },
  { "_id": 6, "customer_id": "A124", "amount": 100, "status": "completed", "category": "clothing", "date": "2024-11-06" },
  { "_id": 7, "customer_id": "A127", "amount": 300, "status": "completed", "category": "home", "date": "2024-11-07" },
  { "_id": 8, "customer_id": "A123", "amount": 700, "status": "completed", "category": "electronics", "date": "2024-11-08" }
]


$group:

Used to group documents by a specific field or expression. You can also compute aggregate values like sums, averages, counts, etc., for each group.
Example:
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$customer_id", totalAmount: { $sum: "$amount" } } }
]);

This groups documents by the category field and computes the total amount for each category.
[
  { "_id": "A123", "totalAmount": 1400 },
  { "_id": "A124", "totalAmount": 250 },
  { "_id": "A126", "totalAmount": 750 },
  { "_id": "A127", "totalAmount": 300 }
]


$project:

Modifies the shape of the documents that pass through it. You can include, exclude, or rename fields.
Example:
db.collection.aggregate([
  { $project: { _id: 0, name: 1, age: 1 } }
]);
This projects only the name and age fields for each document, excluding the _id.

db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$customer_id", totalAmount: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
  { $addFields: { discountedAmount: { $multiply: ["$totalAmount", 0.9] } } },
  { $sort: { totalAmount: -1 } },
  { $limit: 3 },
  { $project: { _id: 0, customer_id: "$_id", totalAmount: 1, discountedAmount: 1 } }
]);

[
  { "customer_id": "A123", "totalAmount": 1400, "discountedAmount": 1260 },
  { "customer_id": "A126", "totalAmount": 750, "discountedAmount": 675 },
  { "customer_id": "A127", "totalAmount": 300, "discountedAmount": 270 }
]


$sort:

Sorts the documents based on a specified field in either ascending or descending order.
Example:
db.collection.aggregate([
  { $sort: { age: 1 } }  // Sort by age in ascending order
]);
This would sort the documents by age in ascending order.

db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$customer_id", totalAmount: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
  { $addFields: { discountedAmount: { $multiply: ["$totalAmount", 0.9] } } },
  { $sort: { totalAmount: -1 } }
]);

[
  { "_id": "A123", "totalAmount": 1400, "discountedAmount": 1260 },
  { "_id": "A126", "totalAmount": 750, "discountedAmount": 675 },
  { "_id": "A127", "totalAmount": 300, "discountedAmount": 270 },
  { "_id": "A124", "totalAmount": 250, "discountedAmount": 225 }
]


$limit:

Limits the number of documents passed to the next stage of the pipeline.
Example:
db.collection.aggregate([
  { $limit: 5 }
]);
This will return only the first 5 documents.

db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$customer_id", totalAmount: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
  { $addFields: { discountedAmount: { $multiply: ["$totalAmount", 0.9] } } },
  { $sort: { totalAmount: -1 } },
  { $limit: 3 }
]);

[
  { "_id": "A123", "totalAmount": 1400, "discountedAmount": 1260 },
  { "_id": "A126", "totalAmount": 750, "discountedAmount": 675 },
  { "_id": "A127", "totalAmount": 300, "discountedAmount": 270 }
]



$skip:

Skips over a specified number of documents.
Example:
db.collection.aggregate([
  { $skip: 10 }
]);
This will skip the first 10 documents and pass the rest to the next stage.

[
  { "_id": 1, "name": "Product A", "tags": ["electronics", "sale"], "price": 100 },
  { "_id": 2, "name": "Product B", "tags": ["clothing", "new"], "price": 50 },
  { "_id": 3, "name": "Product C", "tags": ["electronics", "bestseller"], "price": 200 },
  { "_id": 4, "name": "Product D", "tags": ["home", "new"], "price": 30 },
  { "_id": 5, "name": "Product E", "tags": ["clothing", "sale"], "price": 150 },
  { "_id": 6, "name": "Product F", "tags": ["electronics", "new"], "price": 120 },
  { "_id": 7, "name": "Product G", "tags": ["home", "sale"], "price": 80 },
  { "_id": 8, "name": "Product H", "tags": ["clothing", "bestseller"], "price": 60 }
]


db.products.aggregate([
  { $skip: 4 }
]);

[
  { "_id": 5, "name": "Product E", "tags": ["clothing", "sale"], "price": 150 },
  { "_id": 6, "name": "Product F", "tags": ["electronics", "new"], "price": 120 },
  { "_id": 7, "name": "Product G", "tags": ["home", "sale"], "price": 80 },
  { "_id": 8, "name": "Product H", "tags": ["clothing", "bestseller"], "price": 60 }
]


$unwind:

Deconstructs an array field from the documents, creating a separate document for each element of the array.
Example:
If a document has an array of tags, this stage will create one document for each tag.

db.products.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$tags" }
]);

[
  { "_id": 1, "name": "Product A", "tags": "electronics", "price": 100 },
  { "_id": 1, "name": "Product A", "tags": "sale", "price": 100 },
  { "_id": 2, "name": "Product B", "tags": "clothing", "price": 50 },
  { "_id": 2, "name": "Product B", "tags": "new", "price": 50 },
  { "_id": 3, "name": "Product C", "tags": "electronics", "price": 200 },
  { "_id": 3, "name": "Product C", "tags": "bestseller", "price": 200 },
  { "_id": 4, "name": "Product D", "tags": "home", "price": 30 },
  { "_id": 4, "name": "Product D", "tags": "new", "price": 30 },
  { "_id": 5, "name": "Product E", "tags": "clothing", "price": 150 },
  { "_id": 5, "name": "Product E", "tags": "sale", "price": 150 },
  { "_id": 6, "name": "Product F", "tags": "electronics", "price": 120 },
  { "_id": 6, "name": "Product F", "tags": "new", "price": 120 },
  { "_id": 7, "name": "Product G", "tags": "home", "price": 80 },
  { "_id": 7, "name": "Product G", "tags": "sale", "price": 80 },
  { "_id": 8, "name": "Product H", "tags": "clothing", "price": 60 },
  { "_id": 8, "name": "Product H", "tags": "bestseller", "price": 60 }
]



$addFields:

Adds new fields to documents or modifies existing ones.
Example:
db.collection.aggregate([
  { $addFields: { total: { $multiply: ["$price", "$quantity"] } } }
]);
This adds a new field total to each document, calculated by multiplying the price and quantity fields.


$lookup:
Performs a join between two collections. This is like an SQL JOIN.
Example:
This looks up documents from the products collection based on the productId field and joins them with the orders collection.



Dataset:
Orders Collection:
[
  { "_id": 1, "orderId": "A123", "productId": 101, "quantity": 2 },
  { "_id": 2, "orderId": "B456", "productId": 102, "quantity": 1 },
  { "_id": 3, "orderId": "C789", "productId": 101, "quantity": 3 }
]

Products Collection:
[
  { "_id": 101, "name": "Laptop", "price": 1000 },
  { "_id": 102, "name": "Smartphone", "price": 500 }
]

Using $lookup to Join orders and products:

db.orders.aggregate([
  { 
    $lookup: {
      from: "products",       // The collection to join (products)
      localField: "productId", // Field from the orders collection
      foreignField: "_id",     // Field from the products collection
      as: "productDetails"     // The name of the new field that will hold the joined data
    }
  }
]);

Output:
[
  {
    "_id": 1,
    "orderId": "A123",
    "productId": 101,
    "quantity": 2,
    "productDetails": [
      { "_id": 101, "name": "Laptop", "price": 1000 }
    ]
  },
  {
    "_id": 2,
    "orderId": "B456",
    "productId": 102,
    "quantity": 1,
    "productDetails": [
      { "_id": 102, "name": "Smartphone", "price": 500 }
    ]
  },
  {
    "_id": 3,
    "orderId": "C789",
    "productId": 101,
    "quantity": 3,
    "productDetails": [
      { "_id": 101, "name": "Laptop", "price": 1000 }
    ]
  }
]


$out:

Writes the results of the aggregation to a new collection.
Example:

[
  { "_id": 1, "category": "electronics", "amount": 1000 },
  { "_id": 2, "category": "clothing", "amount": 500 },
  { "_id": 3, "category": "electronics", "amount": 1200 },
  { "_id": 4, "category": "clothing", "amount": 700 },
  { "_id": 5, "category": "home", "amount": 300 }
]

db.sales.aggregate([
  { 
    $group: {
      _id: "$category",              // Group by category
      totalAmount: { $sum: "$amount" } // Sum the amount for each category
    }
  },
  { 
    $out: "category_totals" // Output the result to a new collection called "category_totals"
  }
]);

This will output the results of the aggregation to a new collection called category_totals.

Example Aggregation Pipeline
Let’s walk through an example pipeline with multiple stages:

db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },
  { $group: {
      _id: "$customer_id",
      totalSpent: { $sum: "$amount" }
  }},
  { $sort: { totalSpent: -1 } },
  { $limit: 5 }
]);


[
  { "_id": "electronics", "totalAmount": 2200 },
  { "_id": "clothing", "totalAmount": 1200 },
  { "_id": "home", "totalAmount": 300 }
]


How this works:
$match: Filters for only "completed" orders.
$group: Groups the documents by customer_id and calculates the total amount spent by each customer using the $sum operator.
$sort: Sorts the grouped results by totalSpent in descending order, so the customers who spent the most appear first.
$limit: Limits the output to the top 5 customers.


Complex Aggregation Example
Let's combine some operators to get a more complex aggregation:
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },
  { $group: { 
      _id: "$customer_id",
      totalSpent: { $sum: "$amount" },
      averageSpent: { $avg: "$amount" },
      orderCount: { $sum: 1 }
  }},
  { $match: { totalSpent: { $gte: 1000 } } }, // Only customers who spent at least $1000
  { $sort: { totalSpent: -1 } }
]);

Explanation:
$match: Filters completed orders.
$group: Groups by customer_id, summing the amount to get totalSpent, calculating the averageSpent, and counting the number of orders per customer.
$match: Filters out customers who spent less than $1000.
$sort: Sorts customers by the total amount spent in descending order.
