The initTiltAnimation function is responsible for adding a "tilt" animation to elements on a webpage using the VanillaTilt library.

Let's break down how it works step-by-step:

Importing VanillaTilt:

import VanillaTilt from "vanilla-tilt";

VanillaTilt is a lightweight JavaScript library that adds tilt effects to HTML elements. 
The library is being imported here so that it can be used to apply tilt animations.

initTiltAnimation Function:

export default function initTiltAnimation() {
  const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".js-tilt");
  VanillaTilt.init(elements);
}

This function is exported as the default export so it can be imported and called from other 
parts of the project, such as in a main script like script.js.

Selecting Elements:

const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".js-tilt");

document.querySelectorAll(".js-tilt") is used to select all the DOM elements with the class .js-tilt.
elements now contains a NodeList of all elements in the DOM that have the class js-tilt.

For example, if you have HTML like this:

<div class="js-tilt">Element 1</div>
<div class="js-tilt">Element 2</div>

Both div elements will be selected.


Initializing VanillaTilt:

VanillaTilt.init(elements);

This line applies the VanillaTilt animation to all selected elements.

VanillaTilt.init() is a method provided by the VanillaTilt library, and it can accept a single DOM element,
an array of elements, or a NodeList (which is what querySelectorAll returns).

Once initialized, the tilt effect is applied to each element that was selected.

What Does VanillaTilt Do?

VanillaTilt applies a 3D tilt effect to HTML elements based on mouse movements. When you hover over an element with 
the tilt effect, it moves and tilts dynamically, giving the illusion of depth.

You can control various parameters of the tilt effect, such as how sensitive the tilt is or whether
it has glare or scaling effects, by passing an options object to VanillaTilt.init().

Example:
Here's how the effect would look if applied to some elements in your HTML.

<div class="js-tilt" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; background-color: lightblue;">
  Hover over me!
</div>
<div class="js-tilt" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; background-color: lightgreen;">
  Hover over me too!
</div>

JavaScript (Using initTiltAnimation):
import VanillaTilt from "vanilla-tilt";

export default function initTiltAnimation() {
  const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".js-tilt");
  VanillaTilt.init(elements, {
    max: 25,  // Max tilt rotation in degrees
    speed: 400,  // Speed of the entering/exiting transition
    glare: true,  // Adds a "glare" effect
    "max-glare": 0.5,  // Maximum "glare" opacity
  });
}

How It Works:
Once you call initTiltAnimation(), it selects all elements with the class .js-tilt and applies the tilt effect using VanillaTilt.

As you hover over each element, the tilt effect is dynamically applied, making the element appear to rotate
slightly based on the mouse position. The options (e.g., max: 25, speed: 400, glare: true) allow you to fine-tune how the tilt behaves.

This code is typically called in a main script (e.g., script.js) that initializes all interactions when the page loads.

Final Example of How It Fits with script.js:

import initTiltAnimation from './scripts/tiltAnimation';

initTiltAnimation(); // Initializes the tilt effect on page load
This ensures that your elements with the class .js-tilt will have the tilt effect when the page is loaded.
