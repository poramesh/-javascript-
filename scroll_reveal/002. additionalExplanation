Let's break down the code you shared step-by-step to understand its meaning:

1. !targetElements.length

In JavaScript, targetElements.length gives the number of elements in the targetElements array.
The ! (logical NOT operator) negates the value of targetElements.length.

If targetElements.length is 0 (i.e., the array is empty), !targetElements.length will evaluate to true.

If targetElements.length is greater than 0 (i.e., the array has elements), !targetElements.length
will evaluate to false.


This means the line:

if (!targetElements.length) return;

is checking whether the targetElements array is empty. If it is empty, the function will stop executing and
return early, meaning it will not attempt to apply any animations because there
are no target elements to animate.

2. ScrollReveal({ reset: false })

This line initializes the ScrollReveal library with some global settings. Specifically, it sets reset: false.

The reset option in ScrollReveal controls whether the animation resets every time the element comes into view. When reset: true,
the animation will replay every time the user scrolls the element into view. When reset: false, the animation will only play
once — the first time the element comes into view, and it won’t repeat even if you scroll the element out of view and back in.

In this case, reset: false means that the animations will only play once, which is common behavior for these types of reveal animations.

3. Object.assign({}, defaultProps, animation)

This line uses the Object.assign() method to merge multiple objects into one.

Object.assign({}, defaultProps, animation) creates a new object by merging the properties of defaultProps and animation.

The first parameter, {}, is an empty object. This tells JavaScript to copy the properties of defaultProps and animation into a
new object instead of modifying the original objects.

defaultProps contains the default animation properties like distance, duration, easing, etc.

animation contains any custom animation properties for each specific element.

By using Object.assign({}, defaultProps, animation), the function combines the default animation settings (from defaultProps) with the specific animation
settings (from animation). The custom properties in animation will overwrite any conflicting properties from defaultProps.

Example:

const defaultProps = {
  duration: 1000,
  distance: "30px",
  easing: "ease-in-out"
};

const animation = {
  distance: "50px",
  delay: 300
};

const finalAnimation = Object.assign({}, defaultProps, animation);
console.log(finalAnimation);

This would result in the following merged object:

{
  "duration": 1000,
  "distance": "50px", // 'animation.distance' overrides 'defaultProps.distance'
  "easing": "ease-in-out",
  "delay": 300
}

In this way, Object.assign() ensures that any specific properties (like distance or delay) that are
passed in animation will override the defaults, while the other default settings (like easing and duration) 
will still be applied if they are not overridden.



MORE ON Object.assign() 

this method in JavaScript is used to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects 
to a target object. It returns the target object with the merged properties.


Object.assign(target, ...sources)

target: The object to which properties will be copied. It will receive the properties of the source objects.
sources: One or more source objects whose properties will be copied to the target object.


Key Points:

Shallow Copy: Object.assign() only performs a shallow copy of the properties. If a property is an object or array, 
the reference to that object is copied, not the object itself.

Property Overwriting: If multiple source objects have properties with the same name, properties
from later objects overwrite properties from earlier objects.

Immutability: The target object is mutated, but the source objects are not.

example:

1.
const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source = { b: 4, c: 5 };

const result = Object.assign(target, source);
console.log(result);
// Output: { a: 1, b: 4, c: 5 }

2.

const target = { a: 1 };
const source1 = { b: 2 };
const source2 = { c: 3 };

Object.assign(target, source1, source2);
console.log(target);
// Output: { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }


3.

const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
const source1 = { b: 4, c: 5 };
const source2 = { c: 6, d: 7 };

Object.assign(target, source1, source2);
console.log(target);
// Output: { a: 1, b: 4, c: 6, d: 7 }
