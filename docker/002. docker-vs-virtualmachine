Docker vs. Virtual Machines (VMs):

Docker is a virtualization tool that simplifies running applications by packaging them into containers.
Both Docker and virtual machines (VMs) are virtualization technologies, but they virtualize different layers of the operating system.

Operating System Layers: os is made of kernel and appplication layer

Kernel Layer:
The kernel communicates with the hardware (e.g., CPU, memory, storage).
It allocates system resources to applications.

Applications Layer:
This layer runs on top of the kernel and includes the apps users interact with.

How Docker and VMs Virtualize the OS:

Docker virtualizes only the applications layer of the operating system.
Containers run on the host system’s kernel.
Docker doesn't need its own kernel, which makes its images smaller and faster to start.

VMs virtualize the entire operating system, including the kernel and applications layer.
VMs have their own kernel, which makes them heavier and slower to start compared to Docker containers.
A VM image can be several gigabytes, while a Docker image is usually much smaller (a few megabytes).

Key Differences Between Docker and Virtual Machines:

Size:
Docker images are smaller (usually a few megabytes) because they only include the application layer.
VM images are larger (several gigabytes) since they include the whole OS, including the kernel.

Startup Time:
Docker containers start quickly (in milliseconds) as they reuse the host's kernel.
VMs take longer to boot (minutes) since they have to start up their own kernel.

Compatibility:
VMs allow running any OS on any host OS (e.g., running a Linux VM on a Windows host).
Docker, on the other hand, can only run containers compatible with the host’s kernel. This means you can't directly run Linux-based Docker containers 
on a Windows host.

--------------------------------------------
Running a virtual machine (VM) allows you to create a "virtual" version of a computer within your existing system.
This virtual setup operates independently of the main (host) operating system, which is why you can run any OS on any host OS.

For example, if your primary system is Windows, you can still create a VM that runs Linux. Here’s how it works:

Host OS: This is the main operating system on your physical machine (e.g., Windows).
Guest OS: This is the operating system that runs inside the VM (e.g., Linux, macOS, another version of Windows).
Hypervisor: This software (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox) manages the VM, acting as a bridge between the host and the guest OS.
It allocates resources like CPU, memory, and storage to the VM, allowing the guest OS to operate as if it were
running on its own physical hardware.

With VMs, you can switch between operating systems without needing separate physical computers. 
This flexibility is great for testing, development, and running applications that might be OS-specific.

Running Linux-Based Docker Containers on Windows/Mac:
Docker was initially built for Linux and many popular services have Linux-based containers.
Docker made it possible to run Linux containers on Windows and Mac using Docker Desktop.
Docker Desktop uses a hypervisor layer with a lightweight Linux distribution to provide the necessary Linux kernel, allowing Linux-based containers to
run on Windows/Mac.
