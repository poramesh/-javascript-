Differences Between 127.0.0.1 and Other IP Addresses:

127.0.0.1 (Loopback):
Only accessible from the same machine or container.
Requests to this address never go over an external network.

0.0.0.0:
Binds to all available network interfaces, making the service accessible externally.
Includes loopback (127.0.0.1) and any other network interfaces on the machine.

Public or Private IP (e.g., 192.168.1.10):
Binds to a specific network interface.
Determines how and from where the application can be accessed.

In Docker Context:
Binding to 127.0.0.1:
The service inside the container will only accept connections originating from within the container.
Binding to 0.0.0.0:
The service will accept connections from external sources (host machine, other containers, etc.) as long as ports are mapped using -p.

Example: If you start a Flask app with:
flask run

By default:
Flask binds to 127.0.0.1, meaning the app is only accessible within the container.

Adding --host=0.0.0.0 makes it accessible outside the container.
In summary, 127.0.0.1 is an IP address for local communication only and is essential for isolating processes during development or testing.
