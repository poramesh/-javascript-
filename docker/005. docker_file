A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image. Each instruction in a Dockerfile represents a 
command that Docker executes to assemble the image. Here’s a breakdown of some commonly used build instructions:

Basic Structure of a Dockerfile
___________________________

# Specify the base image
FROM <base-image>

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /path/to/directory (CD)

# Copy files from the host to the container
COPY <source> <destination>

# Install any dependencies
RUN <command to install dependencies>

# Expose a port
EXPOSE <port>

# Specify the command to run when the container starts
CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"]

________________________________________

Basic Dockerfile Instructions


1. FROM: Specifies the base image to use for the new image.
FROM ubuntu:latest //The FROM instruction pulls the specified base image from Docker Hub if it's not already available locally.

2. RUN : Executes a command in the shell to install packages or perform other tasks during the image build process.
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx

3. COPY : Copies files or directories from the host filesystem to the image.
COPY . /app

4.ADD : Similar to COPY, but also supports extracting compressed files and fetching files from URLs.
ADD myfile.tar.gz /app/

5. CMD : Specifies the default command to run when a container is started from the image. This can be overridden when running the container.
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

6. ENTRYPOINT : Configures a container to run as an executable. It sets the main command that will be run, which cannot be overridden when the container starts.
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]

7. ENV : Sets environment variables within the image.
ENV APP_ENV=production

8. WORKDIR : Sets the working directory for subsequent instructions. If the directory does not exist, it will be created. its like CD(chanding directory)
WORKDIR /app

9. EXPOSE : Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. This is a documentation feature and does not actually publish the ports.
EXPOSE 80

10. VOLUME : Creates a mount point with the specified path and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other containers.
VOLUME ["/data"]

Example Dockerfile
Here’s a simple example of a Dockerfile that sets up a Node.js application:


FROM node:14 # Use the official Node.js image as a base
WORKDIR /app # Set the working directory in the container
COPY package*.json ./ # Copy package.json and package-lock.json
RUN npm install # Install dependencies 
COPY . . # Copy the rest of the application code
EXPOSE 3000 # Expose port 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"] # Start the application

Building an Image from a Dockerfile
To build an image from a Dockerfile, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run:


docker build -t my-node-app .
This command creates an image named my-node-app based on the instructions in the Dockerfile located in the current directory (.).

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Building the Docker Image:

After writing the Dockerfile, you’ll build the Docker image using the docker build command. This command reads the Dockerfile,
executes each directive, and packages everything into an image:


now lets build a docker image by creating an app and then docker file.

lets start for node js app.

// src/server.js 

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req,res)=>{
     res.send("Welcome to my awesome app!"); 
 });

app.listen(3000, function () {
    console.log("app listening on port 3000");
});



//docker file

FROM node:19-alpine

# Copy package.json, wildcard used so both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# slash '/' at the end of app is important, so it created an app directory, otherwise you'll get an error
COPY package*.json /usr/app/ (COPY package.json/app/)

# Copy app files from src directory
COPY src /usr/app/ (COPY src /app/)

# Create app directory & set default dir so that next commands executes in /usr/app dir, liked cd-ing into /usr/app to execute npm install
WORKDIR /usr/app

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "server.js"]

_____________
now we can build an image out of the docker file:

docker build -t node-app:1.0 .

-t node-app: Tags the image with the name node-app.
.: The build context, which tells Docker to look for the Dockerfile and all necessary files in the current directory.

after building the image, you can list the available Docker images using the command:

docker images

This will show all Docker images, including the newly created node-app:1.0 image.

Once the image is built, it can be run as a container using:

docker run -d -p 3000:3000 node-app

-p 3000:3000: Maps the container's port 3000 to your local machine’s port 3000.
-d (detach mode): This flag runs the container in the background, allowing you to continue using the terminal while the container is running.
-p (port mapping): This flag exposes the container’s internal port (3000 in the Node.js app) to a port on your host machine 
(also 3000 in this example). Now, you can access the application in the browser via localhost:3000.

You use docker pull explicitly when you want to manually fetch a Docker image from a container registry without building a container or running a container 
based on the image. This is typically done in the following scenarios:

1. Pre-fetching an Image
If you want to download an image to ensure it’s available locally before using it in a Dockerfile, script, or deployment:

docker pull python:3.10-slim
This is useful in CI/CD pipelines or when preparing environments.

2. Testing or Exploring an Image
If you want to inspect an image or verify its contents before using it:

docker pull nginx:latest
docker run -it nginx:latest bash

3. Working with Specific Registries
When you're working with images hosted on custom or private registries, you might pull them explicitly to ensure access and credentials work:

docker pull myregistry.com/myimage:tag

4. Updating Local Cache
If a base image in your Dockerfile is out-of-date and you want to ensure the latest version is used:

docker pull ubuntu:20.04

5. Avoiding Build-Time Pulls
To speed up builds or avoid network issues during a docker build, you can pull the base image ahead of time:

docker pull node:16-alpine
docker build -t myapp .

You don’t need to run docker pull if:
You're building an image directly using a Dockerfile, as Docker will automatically pull the base image if it’s not already available locally.
You're running a container (docker run) for the first time with an image that isn’t present locally.
Example with Automatic Pull:

If you have a Dockerfile like this:

FROM python:3.10-slim

When you run:

docker build -t my-python-app .
Docker will automatically pull python:3.10-slim if it's not available locally. In this case, you don’t need to run docker pull separately.
