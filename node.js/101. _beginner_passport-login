you are going to start off with
>> npm init 
it basically helps you with dependencies.
and keep pressing enter for bunch of times.

and it will give you package.json which is where we are going to store  all our dependencies.

>> npm i express(application server) 
>> npm i ejs(templating lang) 
>> npm i --save-dev(development only) 
>> npm i nodemon(restart our server automatically when we make change )  dotenv(whihc allows env variables which we can store in the file
which we can load into our server)


you add .env and node_modules to .gitignore cause .env got sensitive info and node_modules contains dependenscies

________________

inside the script section from the package.json, remove this line

"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"

and paste it with 

"devstart":"nodemon server.js"

create the server.js file
__________________
and then if you run
 
>>npm run devstart
________________________

everytime we make change to the server, it will restart the server and rerun all over again.

since we have mentioned app.listen(3000) we have to go to localhost:3000 to see whats happenign there.

npm i bcrypt 


npm i passport passport-local express-session express-flash

const initializePassport = require('./passport-config')
initializePassport(passport)


 this is how we import a file in js.
