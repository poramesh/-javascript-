it's generally a good practice for the name of the input fields in your HTML forms to match the property names defined in your schema 
when you're working with a framework like Mongoose in a Node.js application. Here’s why:

1. Consistency:
Keeping the names consistent between your HTML form and your schema helps avoid confusion and makes the code easier to read and maintain. 
When you see name in both places, it’s clear that they refer to the same data.

2. Data Binding:
When a form is submitted, the values of the input fields are sent to the server as key-value pairs. The key (i.e., the name attribute)
will be used to access the corresponding property on the request body (e.g., req.body.name). If the names match the schema, 
you can directly map the incoming data to the model.
Example:
Suppose you have the following Mongoose schema:

const authorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  age: { type: Number, required: true },
});

And in your HTML form, you would define input fields like this:

<form action="/authors" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" value="<%= author.name %>">
  <input type="number" name="age" value="<%= author.age %>">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
  
3. Processing the Form Data:

When you receive the form data in your server route handler, you can easily access the submitted values:

app.post('/authors', (req, res) => {
  const { name, age } = req.body;
  const newAuthor = new Author({ name, age });
  
  newAuthor.save()
    .then(() => res.redirect('/authors'))
    .catch(err => res.status(400).send(err));
});


If the names of the input fields in your HTML form do not match the property names defined in your Mongoose schema, you'll need to
handle the mapping of the data manually when processing the form submission. Here's how it would look and what you need to consider:

Example Schema
Let's say you have the following Mongoose schema:

const authorSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  fullName: { type: String, required: true }, // Property in schema
  age: { type: Number, required: true },
});

HTML Form with Different Input Names
  
If your HTML form has input fields with names that don't match the schema, it might look like this:


<form action="/authors" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="name" value="<%= author.fullName %>"> <!-- Different name -->
  <input type="number" name="years" value="<%= author.age %>"> <!-- Different name -->
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
Handling the Form Submission
  
In your route handler, you would need to extract the submitted values and map them to the schema properties manually:

app.post('/authors', (req, res) => {
  // Extract values from req.body
  const { name, years } = req.body; // These do not match the schema directly

  // Map to the schema properties
  const newAuthor = new Author({
    fullName: name, // Map 'name' to 'fullName'
    age: years,     // Map 'years' to 'age'
  });

  newAuthor.save()
    .then(() => res.redirect('/authors'))
    .catch(err => res.status(400).send(err));
});
  


  (or)

const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const Author = require('../models/author'); // Import your Author model

router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Map incoming form field names to the schema properties
    const authorData = {
      fullName: req.body.name, // Mapping 'name' to 'fullName'
      age: req.body.years,      // Mapping 'years' to 'age'
    };

    // Create a new author document using the mapped data
    const author = new Author(authorData);

    // Save the author to the database
    await author.save();

    // Redirect or send a response after saving
    res.redirect('/authors'); // Redirect to the authors page, or handle as needed
  } catch {
    res.render('authors/new',{ author:author,
                              errorMessage:'error creteing author'
    })
  }
});



// GET route to render the new author form
router.get('/new', (req, res) => {
  res.render('authors/new', { author: new Author() }); // Pass an empty author object if needed
});

new Author() creates an instance of the Author model, giving your template access to a structured but empty object.
This helps in rendering forms for creating new authors while ensuring that you adhere to the schema defined in your application. 
It allows you to prepare for potential future use cases, like pre-filling the form for editing existing authors,
where you would pass an existing author object instead of a new one.



New Data Submission:

When the user fills out the form and submits it, the values in the form fields represent new data that needs to be processed and saved.
The initial author object passed to the form during the GET request is empty (or pre-filled for editing) and does not contain this new data.

Separation of Concerns:

The author object created during the GET request is meant solely for rendering the form, not for processing or storing data.
When the form is submitted, the new data from the request body (req.body) needs to be encapsulated in a new instance of the author object.

Validation and Middleware:

By creating a new author object upon form submission, you can easily perform validation and checks on the new data before saving it to the database
