Routing refers to how an applicationâ€™s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. 

Route definition takes the following structure:

app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)
Where:
app is an instance of express.
METHOD is an HTTP request method, in lowercase.
PATH is a path on the server.
HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.
