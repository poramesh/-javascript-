The FS Module

This module helps you with file handling operations such as:

Reading a file (sync or async way)
Writing to a file (sync or async way)
Deleting a file
Reading the contents of a director
Renaming a file
Watching for changes in a file, and much more


___________
fs.mkdir()
___________

The fs.mkdir() function in Node.js is used to create a new directory. 

It takes two arguments: the path of the directory to be created 
and an optional callback function that gets executed when the operation is complete.

path: Here, path refers to the location where you want to create a new folder. This can be an absolute or a relative path. 
In my case, the path to the present working directory (the folder I am currently in), is: C:\Desktop\NodeJSTut.

callback function: The purpose of the callback function is to notify that the directory creation process has completed.
This is necessary because the fs.mkdir() function is asynchronous, meaning that it does not block the execution of the rest of the code 
while the operation is in progress. Instead, it immediately returns control to the callback function,
allowing it to continue executing other tasks. Once the directory has been created, the callback function is called with
an error object (if any) and any other relevant data related to the operation.
In the below code, we are just using it to display a success message in the console or any error.

const fs = require('fs');

// Present Working Directory: C:\Desktop\NodeJSTut
// Making a new directory called ./myFolder:

fs.mkdir('./myFolder', (err) => {
    if(err){
        console.log(err);
    } else{
        console.log('Folder Created Successfully');
    }
})

After executing the above code, you will see a new folder called myFolder created in the NodeJSTut directory.


______________
fs.writeFile()
_______________

After the myFolder directory is created successfully, it's time to create a file and write something to it by using the fs module.

There are basically 2 ways of doing this:

Synchronous Approach: In this approach, we create a file and write the data to it in a blocking manner, which means that NodeJS waits for 
the creation and write operation to complete before moving on to the next line of code. If an error occurs during this process, it throws an exception
that must be caught using try...catch.


Asynchronous Approach: In this approach, we create and write data to a file in a non-blocking manner, which means that NodeJS does not wait for 
the write operation to complete before moving on to the next line of code. Instead, it takes a callback function that gets
called once the entire process is completed. If an error occurs during the write operation, the error object is passed to the callback function.

In this tutorial, we will be using the fs.writeFile() function which follows the asynchronous approach.

The method takes three arguments:

The path of the file to write to (including the file name and extension)
The data to write to the file (as a string or buffer)
An optional callback function that is called once the write operation is complete or an error occurs during the write operation.

When writeFile() is called, Node.js creates a new file or overwrites an existing file at the specified path. It then writes the
provided data to the file and closes it. Since the method is asynchronous, the write operation does not block the event loop,
allowing other operations to be performed in the meantime.

Below is the code where we create a new file called myFile.txt in the myFolder directory and write this data to it: Hi,this is newFile.txt.

const fs = require('fs');

const data = "Hi,this is newFile.txt";

fs.writeFile('./myFolder/myFile.txt', data, (err)=> {
    if(err){
        console.log(err);
        return;
    } else {
        console.log('Writen to file successfully!');
    }
})


Since newFile.txt didn't exist previously, Hence the writeFile() function created this file for us on the provided path and then
wrote the value in the data variable to the file. Suppose this file already existed. In that case, writeFile() will just open the file
, erase all the existing text present in it and then write the data to it.

The problem with this code is: when you run the same code multiple times, it erases the previous data that is already present in newFile.txt
and writes the data to it.

In case you do not want the original data to get deleted and just want the new data to be added/appended at the end of the file,
you need to make a little change in the above code by adding this "options object": {flag: 'a'} 
as the third parameter to writeFile() – like this:

const fs = require('fs');

const data = 'Hi,this is newFile.txt';

fs.writeFile('./myFolder/myFile.txt', data, {flag: 'a'}, (err) => {
    if(err){
        console.log(err);
        return;
    } else {
        console.log('Writen to file successfully!');
    }
})


_______________
fs.readFile()
_____________


Again there are 2 ways of doing this: Synchronous approach and the Asynchronous approach (just like the previous function). 
Here we are going to use the readFile() function provided by fs module which performs the reading operation asynchronously.

The readFile() function takes 3 parameters:

>The path to the file which is to be read.

>The encoding of the file.

>The callback function that gets executed once the reading operation is completed or if any error occurs during the reading operation.
It accepts 2 parameters: first parameter stores the file data (if read operation is successful) and the second parameter
stores the error object (if read operation fails due to some error).



const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('./myFolder/myFile.txt', {encoding: 'utf-8'}, (err, data) => {
    if(err){
        console.log(err);
        return;
    } else {
        console.log('File read successfully! Here is the data');
        console.log(data);
    }
})


It is to be noted here that the encoding property is set to 'utf-8'. At this point, some of you may not know about the encoding property,

The encoding parameter in the fs.readFile() method of Node.js is used to specify the character encoding used to interpret 
the file data. By default, if no encoding parameter is provided, the method returns a raw buffer.

<Buffer 54 68 69 73 20 69 73 20 73 6f 6d 65 20 64 61 74 61 20 69 6e 20 61 20 66 69 6c 65>

This raw buffer is difficult to read and interpret as it represents the contents of the file in binary form. To convert the buffer to a r
eadable string, you can specify an encoding parameter when calling readFile().

In our case, we specified the 'utf8' encoding as the second parameter of the readFile() method. This tells Node.js to interpret the file
contents as a string using the UTF-8 character encoding

'ascii': Interpret the file contents as ASCII-encoded text.
'utf16le': Interpret the file contents as 16-bit Unicode text in little-endian byte order.
'latin1': Interpret the file contents as ISO-8859-1 (also known as Latin-1) encoded text.

Reading and Writing to a File Synchronously
__________________________________________

readFileSync() and writeFileSync().

Note that since these are synchronous operations, they need to be wrapped in a try...catch block. In case the operations fail for some reason,
the errors thrown will be caught by the catch block.

In the below code, we first create a new file: ./myFolder/myFileSync.txt and write to it using the writeFileSync() method.


const fs = require('fs');

try{
    // Write to file synchronously
    fs.writeFileSync('./myFolder/myFileSync.txt', 'myFileSync says Hi');
    console.log('Write operation successful');

    // Read file synchronously
    const fileData = fs.readFileSync('./myFolder/myFileSync.txt', 'utf-8');
    console.log('Read operation successful. Here is the data:');
    console.log(fileData);

} catch(err){
    console.log('Error occurred!');
    console.log(err);
}

When you run the above code, a new file called myFileSync.txt is created in the myFolder directory and it contains the following text in it: 
myFileSync says Hi. This is the output printed in the console:

Write operation successful
Read operation successful.

Here is the data:
myFileSync says Hi

How to read the contents of a directory using fs.readdir()
_________________________________________________________


If you have been following along until now, you will see that we currently have 2 files in the myFolder directory,
i.e, myFile.txt and myFileSync.txt. The fs module provides you with readdir() function using which you can read the contents of 
a directory (the files and folders present in the directory).

The readdir() function accepts 2 parameters:

>The path of the folder whose contents are to be read.

>Callback function which gets executed once the operation is completed or if any error occurs during the operation.
This function accepts 2 parameters: The first one which accepts the error object (if any error occurs) and the second parameter
which accepts an array of the various files and folders present in the directory whose path has been provided.

const fs = require('fs');
fs.readdir('./myFolder', (err, files) => {
    if(err){
        console.log(err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('Directory read successfully! Here are the files:');
    console.log(files);
})



This is an asynchronous function that reads the contents of the directory specified (in this case, ./myFolder).
The function takes two parameters:
The path of the directory to read ('./myFolder').

A callback function that will execute once the directory has been read or if an error occurs.
   >The callback function (err, files) is passed to fs.readdir and is called when the directory read operation completes. Node.js follows 
   the error-first callback pattern, where the first parameter (err) is reserved for errors, and the second parameter (files) holds the result
   (in this case, an array of file names).

   >If there’s an error, such as the directory not existing, the err parameter will contain details about the error. The code inside the if (err) 
   block will be executed, logging the error and exiting the function.
   >If the directory read is successful, err will be null or undefined, and files will contain an array of file names. The code proceeds to 
   print a success message and the array of files.




[ 'myFile.txt', 'myFileSync.txt' ]


________________________________________
How to rename a file using fs.rename()
________________________________________


The fs.rename() method in Node.js is used to rename a file or directory. The method takes two arguments, the current file path and the new file path, 
and a callback function that is executed when the renaming is complete.

Here's the syntax for the fs.rename() method:

fs.rename(oldPath, newPath, callback);

where:

oldPath (string) - The current file path
newPath (string) - The new file path
callback (function) - A callback function to be executed when the renaming is complete. This function takes an error object as its only parameter.

Let's rename the newFile.txt file to newFileAsync.txt:

const fs = require('fs');

fs.rename('./newFolder/newFile.txt', './newFolder/newFileAsync.txt', (err)=>{
    if(err){
        console.log(err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('File renamed successfully!')
})


Note that you should only provide valid paths (absolute or relative) to the rename() function and not just the names of the files. 
Remember it's oldPath and newPath and NOT oldName and newName.

For example, consider this code: fs.rename('./newFolder/newFile.txt', 'newFileAsync.txt', ...rest of the code). 

In this case, since we did not provide a proper path in the 2nd parameter, rename() assumes that the path to the newly named file should be:
./newFileAsync.txt. Thus, it basically removes the newFile.txt from the newFolder directory, renames the file to newFileAsync.txt and 
moves it to the current working directory.



______________________________________
How to delete a file using fs.unlink()
______________________________________

Last but not the least, we have the fs.unlink() function which is used to delete a file. It takes in 2 parameters:

The path of the file which you want to delete, and
The callback function which gets executed once the delete operation is over or if any error occurs during the operation.

const fs = require('fs');

fs.unlink('./myFolder/myFileSync.txt', (err) => {
    if(err){
        console.log(err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('File Deleted Successfully!')
})




Synchronous File Deletion

Alternatively, you can delete a file synchronously using fs.unlinkSync():

const fs = require('fs');

try {
  fs.unlinkSync('example.txt');
  console.log('File deleted successfully!');
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Error deleting file:', err);
}


_______________
deleting folder:
________________

const fs = require('fs');

// Delete the folder named 'newFolder'
fs.rmdir('newFolder', (err) => {
  if (err) {
    return console.error(err);
  }
  console.log('Directory deleted successfully!');
});

Working with Readable and Writable Streams
__________________________________________


Streams in Node.js are objects that allow you to read data from a source or write data to a destination in a continuous manner.

There are four types of streams in Node.js:

Readable: Stream that is used for reading data.
Writable: Stream used for writing data.
Duplex: Stream that is both readable and writable.
Transform: A type of duplex stream that modifies the data as it is read or written.


 Readable Stream

Let’s read the contents of a file using a readable stream.

const fs = require('fs');
const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('example.txt', 'utf8');

readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log('Data chunk: ', chunk);
});

readableStream.on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err.message);
  });

In this example, the file example.txt is read in chunks, which makes the process efficient when dealing with large files.

Writable Stream

const fs = require('fs');
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');

writableStream.write('Hello, World!\n');
writableStream.write('This is a writable stream.\n');
writableStream.end();

Here, the data is written to the output.txt file.

3. Why You Should Use Streams

Streams are highly efficient, especially when working with large files or large amounts of data, as they process data in chunks 
rather than loading everything into memory at once.

Advantages of Streams:

Memory Efficiency: Since streams process data in chunks, you don't need to load the entire file into memory. This is particularly beneficial 
when handling large files.
Speed: Streams start processing data as soon as it arrives, allowing you to begin working with data immediately rather than waiting for the entire data
set to load.
Asynchronous Operations: Node.js streams are event-driven, which means they allow for non-blocking I/O operations. This is important for maintaining fast, 
responsive applications.

________________________________________________
 Readable Stream with Piping to Writable Stream
 _____________________________________________

Here’s an example that shows the real power of streams by reading from one file and writing to another in chunks using pipe().

const fs = require('fs');
const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('source.txt');
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('destination.txt');

readableStream.pipe(writableStream);

console.log('File copied successfully!');



more example on streams

const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('./example.txt');
const writeSteam  = fs.createWriteStream('./example.txt');
readStream.on('data',(chunk)) =>{
    writeStream.write(chunk);
});


we are basically reading it in chunks instead of reading all at once. the buffer is small.
