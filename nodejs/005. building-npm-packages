Building an npm (Node Package Manager) package involves several steps, from setting up the project to publishing the package. 

1. Set Up Your Project

Create a New Directory for Your Package:
mkdir my-package
cd my-package

Initialize the Project: This step creates a package.json file, which contains metadata about your package.

npm init

Follow the prompts to fill in details like the package name, version, description, entry point (usually index.js), 
test command, repository, keywords, author, and license. You can also accept the defaults.

2. Write Your Package Code

Create Your Main JavaScript File: Typically, this is index.js. Here you write the code for your package.

// index.js
function helloWorld() {
    return "Hello, World!";
}

module.exports = helloWorld;

Add More Files (Optional): If your package is more complex, you can create additional files and organize them as needed.

3. Add Necessary Files

.gitignore (Optional but Recommended): Create a .gitignore file to ignore files you don't want to commit, like node_modules:

gitignore
Copy code
node_modules/

README.md (Optional but Recommended): Write a README.md file to explain what your package does, how to install it, and provide examples.

License (Optional but Recommended): Include a LICENSE file to specify the licensing terms of your package.

4. Test Your Package

Write Tests (Optional but Recommended): Use a testing framework like Jest, Mocha, or another to write tests for your package.

For example, using Jest:

npm install --save-dev jest

Then create a test file:

// test.js
const helloWorld = require('./index');
test('returns Hello, World!', () => {
    expect(helloWorld()).toBe('Hello, World!');
});

Run your tests:

npx jest

5. Publish Your Package

cLog In to npm: If you haven't logged in yet, you need to log in to your npm account:

npm login

Publish Your Package: Once you're ready, publish your package to npm:

npm publish

Note: If your package name is already taken, you may need to change it or publish it under a different scope.

Update the Package Version: Each time you make changes and want to publish a new version, you need to bump the version number in package.json:

npm version patch  # or "minor" or "major"

npm publish

6. Using Your Package

After publishing, you or others can install your package using npm:

npm install my-package

And use it in your project:

const helloWorld = require('my-package');
console.log(helloWorld());

7. (Optional) Automation and Best Practices

Continuous Integration (CI): Set up a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions, Travis CI, or another service to automatically run tests and publish your package.
Linting and Code Quality: Use tools like ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality.
Versioning: Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) to keep track of your package versions.




to uninstall a package you just use npm uninstall *package_name*





SEMANTIC VERSIONING

Semantic Versioning, often abbreviated as SemVer, is a versioning scheme for software that aims to 
convey meaning about the underlying changes with each release.

Dependencies: 4.15.2 

major.minor.patch


MAJOR version: Incremented for incompatible changes that require users to make adjustments.
MINOR version: Incremented for backward-compatible additions or improvements.
PATCH version: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.



Caret(^):

Allows updates that do not change the leftmost non-zero digit of the version number. 

^1.2.3:
Acceptable versions: 1.2.3, 1.3.0, 1.4.5, etc. (patch and minor updates)
Not acceptable: 2.0.0 (major version change, potentially breaking)

^0.2.3 (When the major version is zero, it only allows patch updates):
Acceptable versions: 0.2.3, 0.2.4, 0.2.5, etc.
Not acceptable: 0.3.0 or 1.0.0 (minor and major changes)


Tilde (~):

Allows patch updates but restricts minor and major updates. It will only update the patch number but not the minor or major version.

Example:

~1.2.3:
Acceptable versions: 1.2.3, 1.2.4, 1.2.5, etc. (patch updates only)
Not acceptable: 1.3.0 or 2.0.0 (minor or major version changes)

~0.2.3 (When the major version is zero, behaves similarly):
Acceptable versions: 0.2.3, 0.2.4, 0.2.5, etc.
Not acceptable: 0.3.0 or 1.0.0 (minor and major changes)


^ (Caret): Allows both minor and patch updates, but not major updates.
~ (Tilde): Allows only patch updates, more restrictive than ^.


if we dont mention either of this, it will not update anything. it wil remain the same.
