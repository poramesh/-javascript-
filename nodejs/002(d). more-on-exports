this is what i want to understand.


var Strategy = require('./strategy');

This line is importing the Strategy object (or function/class) from another file called strategy.js in the current directory (./).
require('./strategy') means we are looking for a module named strategy.js in the same directory as the current file.
The value returned from that file will be assigned to the variable Strategy.
For example, if strategy.js exports a class or function called Strategy, then Strategy will now hold that class/function.




2. exports = module.exports = Strategy;

Here, we are making Strategy the default export for the module.
module.exports is the special object that is returned when you require() a module. By default, it is an empty object {},
but we can assign any value to it, and that value will be the exported module.

By setting both exports and module.exports to Strategy, we are:
Replacing the empty object with Strategy, so when this module is required in another file, it directly returns Strategy.
exports is a reference to module.exports, so exports and module.exports are effectively the same thing.When you modify
exports or module.exports, you modify the object that will be exported from the module.

Why both?
exports is a shorthand for the module.exports object. In this line, we’re setting both exports and module.exports to Strategy to
ensure that when someone imports this module, they get Strategy as the module's default export.

This is the same as doing:

module.exports = Strategy;
exports = module.exports;  // This is unnecessary but can be used in some cases for clarity.


3. exports.Strategy = Strategy;

In addition to setting Strategy as the default export, we are also adding Strategy as a property on the exports object.

After the first line (exports = module.exports = Strategy), Strategy is the default export.
In this line, we are also saying that Strategy is a property of the exports object. So, this adds another way to access Strategy.

Now, this module has two ways you can access Strategy:

Default export – require('./your-module') directly gives you Strategy.
As a property of exports – require('./your-module').Strategy gives you Strategy.


Example Breakdown
Assuming strategy.js looks like this:


// strategy.js
class Strategy {
  // Some class logic
}
module.exports = Strategy;
Then in another file, you can import and use Strategy in two ways:

Accessing via default export:

const Strategy = require('./strategy');  // Directly gets the Strategy class
const strategyInstance = new Strategy();  // Create an instance of Strategy

Accessing via the Strategy property of exports:

const strategyModule = require('./strategy');
const Strategy = strategyModule.Strategy;  // Access the Strategy property
const strategyInstance = new Strategy();  // Create an instance of Strategy

Why Do This?

This pattern of exporting is typically used for convenience and flexibility:

Default export (via module.exports) is the most common way to export the main feature or object of the module.
Named export (via exports.Strategy) allows you to access the same thing with a different name, offering flexibility for users of your module.

This is useful when you want to give users of your module two ways to access the same thing or when you want to provide other features in the 
same module in the future.

Summary
module.exports = Strategy makes Strategy the default export of the module.
exports.Strategy = Strategy exposes Strategy as a property of the exports object, giving an alternative way to access it.
Both lines allow other files to import Strategy,
