Node is an environment in which you can run JavaScript code "Outside the web browser".
Node be like – "Hey y'all, you give your JS code to me and I'll run it 



Since Node runs JavaScript code outside the web browser, this means that it doesn't have access
to certain features that are only available in the browser, like the DOM or 
the window object or even the localStorage.

This means that at any point in your code, you can't type in document.querySelector() or alert()
as these will produce errors (This is what is shown in the below image).



Global Variables:


These are basically variables which store some data and can be accessed from anywhere in your code – doesn't matter how deeply nested the code is.

You should know about these commonly used Global variables:

__dirname: This variable stores the path to the current working directory.
__filename: This variable stores the path to the current working file.


console.log(__dirname); //C:\Desktop\NodeJSTut
console.log(__filename); //C:\Desktop\NodeJSTut\app.js


You can go ahead and create your own global variables which can be accessed from anywhere in 
your code. You can do so, like this:

global.myVariable = 'Hello World';
console.log(myVariable); // Output: Hello World
