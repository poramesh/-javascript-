Node is an environment in which you can run JavaScript code "Outside the web browser".
Node be like – "Hey y'all, you give your JS code to me and I'll run it 



Since Node runs JavaScript code outside the web browser, this means that it doesn't have access
to certain features that are only available in the browser, like the DOM or 
the window object or even the localStorage.

This means that at any point in your code, you can't type in document.querySelector() or alert()
as these will produce errors.



Global Variables:


These are basically variables which store some data and can be accessed from anywhere in your code – doesn't matter how deeply nested the code is.

You should know about these commonly used Global variables:

__dirname: This variable stores the path to the current working directory.
__filename: This variable stores the path to the current working file.


console.log(__dirname); //C:\Desktop\NodeJSTut
console.log(__filename); //C:\Desktop\NodeJSTut\app.js


You can go ahead and create your own global variables which can be accessed from anywhere in 
your code. You can do so, like this:

global.myVariable = 'Hello World';



TYPES OF MODULES IN NODE::


There are 2 types of modules in NodeJS:

Built In Modules: These are modules included in Node by default, so you can use them without installation. You just need to
import them and get started.

module name               usage

  OS                  provides info about the operating system
  PATH                provides utility function for working with file paths
  FS                  file system operations like reading adn writing files
  HTTP                create HTTP servers

External Modules: These are modules created by other developers which are not included by default. So you need to install 
them first before using them.






console.log(myVariable); // Output: Hello World
