we have gotta have node js installed and added its path to the environment variable. we cna simply do this by installing the packaage from its official site.
and path will be added automatically.
you can verify if its installed or not by using thsi command 
node -v and npm -v

try not to install it by command line, it wont work.

in order to run a file.js we use node file.js


{
  "name": "realtimechatapp_socketio",    // Name of your project
  "version": "1.0.0",                    // Version of your project
  "main": "index.js",                    // Main entry point file (index.js by default, but your actual file is server.js)
  "scripts": {
    "devstart": "nodemon server.js"      // Script to start the server in development mode using Nodemon
  },
  "author": "",                          // You can add your name here as the author of the project
  "license": "ISC",                      // License for your project (you can change this if needed)
  "description": "",                     // Description of your project (optional)
  "dependencies": {
    "socket.io": "^4.7.5"                // Production dependency - Socket.IO for real-time communication
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.4"                  // Development dependency - Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development
  }
}


"devstart": "nodemon server.js" runs your app in development mode with nodemon, which automatically restarts your server when changes are made to server.js.
