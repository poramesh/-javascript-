that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country):

SELECT CustomerName, CONCAT(Address,', ',PostalCode,', ',City,', ',Country) AS Address FROM Customers;  //Note: To get the SQL statement 
above to work in MySQL use the following:

SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.CustomerName FROM Customers AS c, Orders AS o WHERE c.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND c.CustomerID=o.CustomerID;  
//The following SQL statement selects all the orders from the customer with CustomerID=4 (Around the Horn). We use the "Customers" and "Orders" tables,

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName FROM Customers, Orders WHERE Customers.CustomerName='Around the Horn' AND Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID;  
//The following SQL statement is the same as above, but without aliases:

SQL JOINS:

Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

INNER JOIN:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;


OrderID	CustomerID	OrderDate
10308	2	1996-09-18
10309	37	1996-09-19
10310	77	1996-09-20
Then, look at a selection from the "Customers" table:

CustomerID	CustomerName	ContactName	Country
1	Alfreds Futterkiste	Maria Anders	Germany
2	Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	Ana Trujillo	Mexico
3	Antonio Moreno Taquería	Antonio Moreno	Mexico

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;

will produce this output:

OrderID	CustomerName	OrderDate
10308	Ana Trujillo Emparedados y helados	1996-09-18


LEFT JOIN:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;


Customers Table:
CustomerID	CustomerName
1	Alice
2	Bob
3	Charlie
4	Diana

Orders Table:
OrderID	CustomerID	OrderDate
101	1	2023-09-01
102	2	2023-09-03
103	2	2023-09-04

Left Join Query:

You want to find all customers and any orders they have placed. Even if a customer has not placed any orders, 
you still want their name to show up in the result.

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;

Result of the LEFT JOIN:

CustomerName	OrderID	OrderDate
Alice	101	2023-09-01
Bob	102	2023-09-03
Bob	103	2023-09-04
Charlie	NULL	NULL
Diana	NULL	NULL


RIGHT JOIN:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate
FROM Customers
RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID;


Customers Table:
CustomerID	CustomerName
1	Alice
2	Bob
3	Charlie
4	Diana

Orders Table:
OrderID	CustomerID	OrderDate
101	1	2023-09-01
102	2	2023-09-03
103	2	2023-09-04

Result of the RIGHT JOIN:

CustomerName	OrderID	OrderDate
Alice	101	2023-09-01
Bob	102	2023-09-03
Bob	103	2023-09-05


OUTER JOIN:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;



SELECT c.CustomerName, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate
FROM Customers AS c
FULL OUTER JOIN Orders AS o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;

Customers Table:
CustomerID	CustomerName
1	Alice
2	Bob
3	Charlie
4	Diana

Orders Table:
OrderID	CustomerID	OrderDate
101	1	2023-09-01
102	2	2023-09-03
103	2	2023-09-04

RESULT:

CustomerName	OrderID	OrderDate
Alice	101	2023-09-01
Bob	102	2023-09-03
Bob	103	2023-09-04
Charlie	NULL	NULL
Diana	NULL	NULL


Note:
Some database systems, like MySQL, do not support FULL OUTER JOIN directly. In those cases, you can achieve the same result
by combining a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN with a UNION.

Here's how you can do it in MySQL:

SELECT c.CustomerName, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate
FROM Customers AS c
LEFT JOIN Orders AS o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID
UNION
SELECT c.CustomerName, o.OrderID, o.OrderDate
FROM Customers AS c
RIGHT JOIN Orders AS o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;
This will give you the same result as a FULL OUTER JOIN.


SQL Self Join

A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

Self Join Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;

CustomerID	CustomerName	City
1	Alice	New York
2	Bob	Los Angeles
3	Charlie	New York
4	Diana	Chicago
5	Edward	Los Angeles
6	Frank	San Francisco


SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, 
       B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, 
       A.City
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID //This condition ensures that we only consider pairs of customers that are different. It prevents a customer from being paired with themselves.
AND A.City = B.City
ORDER BY A.City;


Final Result:
CustomerName1	CustomerName2	City 
1 Alice	Charlie	New York
2 Bob	Edward	Los Angeles
3 Charlie Alice New York
5 Edward Bob Los Anglese

if we use A.customerID < B.CustomerID then we can avoid the dupliactes

SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, 
       B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, 
       A.City
FROM Customers A
JOIN Customers B ON A.City = B.City AND A.CustomerID < B.CustomerID
ORDER BY A.City;

Match?
1	Alice	New York	3	Charlie	New York	✅ (Same city, 1 < 3)
2	Bob	Los Angeles	5	Edward	Los Angeles	✅ (Same city, 2 < 5)
3	Charlie	New York	1	Alice	New York	❌ (1 < 3 condition fails)
5	Edward	Los Angeles	2	Bob	Los Angeles	❌ (2 < 5 conditio


UNION

The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.

Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
The columns must also have similar data types
The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order

UNION Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;

To allow duplicate values, use UNION ALL:

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;


Customers Table:
CustomerID	CustomerName	City	Country
1	Alfreds Futterkiste	Berlin	Germany
2	Ana Trujillo Emparedados	Mexico City	Mexico
3	Antonio Moreno Taquería	Frankfurt	Germany
4	Maria Anders	Hamburg	Germany
5	Edward	Madrid	Spain

Suppliers Table:
SupplierID	SupplierName	City	Country
1	Acme Corp	Berlin	Germany
2	Best Supplies	Munich	Germany
3	Super Goods	Los Angeles	USA
4	Global Products	Frankfurt	Germany
5	International Trade	Toronto	Canada



SELECT City, Country 
FROM Customers 
WHERE Country = 'Germany'
UNION ALL
SELECT City, Country 
FROM Suppliers 
WHERE Country = 'Germany'
ORDER BY City;

City	Country
Berlin	Germany
Berlin	Germany
Frankfurt	Germany
Frankfurt	Germany
Hamburg	Germany
Munich	Germany


if UNION

City	Country
Berlin	Germany
Frankfurt	Germany
Hamburg	Germany
Munich	Germany

The SQL GROUP BY Statement

The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

SYntax:
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);

Sales Table:
SaleID	ProductName	Quantity	Price	SaleDate
1	Apple	10	1.00	2024-10-01
2	Banana	5	0.50	2024-10-01
3	Apple	15	1.00	2024-10-02
4	Orange	8	0.75	2024-10-02
5	Banana	7	0.50	2024-10-03
6	Apple	20	1.00	2024-10-03


SELECT ProductName, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM Sales
GROUP BY ProductName
ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC;

result:

ProductName	TotalQuantity
Apple	45
Banana	12
Orange	8


SELECT Shippers.ShipperName,COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
GROUP BY ShipperName;

Result:

ShipperName	NumberOfOrders
Federal Shipping 	68 
Speedy Express 	54 

more example:

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country;

SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
United Package 	74 


The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

HAVING Syntax

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);


SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;

Number of Records: 5
Expr1000	Country
9 	Brazil 
11 	France 
11 	Germany 
7 	UK 
13 	USA 




The SQL EXISTS Operator


The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.
The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.

EXISTS Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE EXISTS
(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;

example:

SELECT SupplierName
FROM Suppliers
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT ProductName 
    FROM Products 
    WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.SupplierID 
    AND Price = 22
);


FROM Suppliers: The query starts by selecting from the Suppliers table.

EXISTS Clause: For each supplier in the Suppliers table, the EXISTS subquery is executed. This subquery checks if 
there are any products associated with the current supplier that have a price of 22.

Subquery Execution:

For Supplier A (SupplierID = 1):
The subquery checks the Products table. It finds one product (Product 2) that matches (Price = 22).
EXISTS returns TRUE, so Supplier A is included in the final result.

________________________________________

Complete Order of Execution in SQL Queries
FROM Clause:
JOINs:
WHERE Clause:
GROUP BY Clause:
HAVING Clause:
SELECT Clause: 
DISTINCT:
ORDER BY Clause:
LIMIT / OFFSET Clause:


Subqueries: If there are subqueries (like the EXISTS clause in your earlier examples), those are executed as
needed during the evaluation of the outer query. The result of the subquery affects how the
outer query processes its data.

Set Operations: If you are using operations like UNION, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT, these are processed after the 
individual queries are executed and their results are combined.

_________________________________________________


The SQL ANY and ALL Operators

The ANY and ALL operators allow you to perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values.

The ANY operator:
returns a boolean value as a result
returns TRUE if ANY of the subquery values meet the condition

ANY means that the condition will be true if the operation is true for any of the values in the range.

ANY Syntax:

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name operator ANY
  (SELECT column_name
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition);

Note: The operator must be a standard comparison operator (=, <>, !=, >, >=, <, or <=).


Products Table:

ProductID	ProductName	Price
1	Product A	15
2	Product B	25
3	Product C	35
4	Product D	45

Sales Table:

SaleID	ProductID	SalePrice
101	1	10
102	2	20
103	3	30
104	4	50

Using ANY:

Let's find products that are more expensive than any of the sale prices from the Sales table.

SQL Query with ANY

SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE Price > ANY (SELECT SalePrice FROM Sales);

ProductName
Product A
Product B
Product C
Product D
Using ALL

Now, let's find products whose prices are greater than all the sale prices from the Sales table.

SQL Query with ALL

SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE Price > ALL (SELECT SalePrice FROM Sales);

Final Result for ALL
ProductName
Empty




SELECT INTO


Employees Table:

EmployeeID	EmployeeName	Department	Salary
1	Alice Johnson	HR	60000
2	Bob Smith	IT	75000
3	Charlie Brown	Finance	70000
4	David Wilson	IT	72000
5	Eva Green	HR	65000

Creating a New Table

1. Copy All Columns Into a New Table
To create a backup of the entire Employees table:

SELECT *
INTO EmployeesBackup
FROM Employees;

Result: This creates a new table named EmployeesBackup with the same structure and data as the Employees table.



2. Copy Specific Columns Into a New Table
If you only want to copy the EmployeeName and Salary columns into a new table:

SELECT EmployeeName, Salary
INTO EmployeeSalaries
FROM Employees;

Result: This creates a new table named EmployeeSalaries containing:

EmployeeName	Salary
Alice Johnson	60000
Bob Smith	75000
Charlie Brown	70000
David Wilson	72000
Eva Green	65000


3. Copy Rows Based on a Condition

If you want to copy only the employees from the IT department into a new table:

SELECT *
INTO ITEmployees
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT';
Result: This creates a new table named ITEmployees with the following data:

EmployeeID	EmployeeName	Department	Salary
2	Bob Smith	IT	75000
4	David Wilson	IT	72000
4. Using IN Clause to Create a Table in Another Database


OHHHH!

If you have a separate database called BackupDB, you can copy the entire Employees table into this new database:

SELECT *
INTO EmployeesBackup IN 'BackupDB'
FROM Employees;

Result: This creates a new table named EmployeesBackup in the BackupDB database with all the data from the Employees table.

Tip: Create an Empty Table Using the Schema of Another

If you want to create an empty table based on the Employees table structure, you can do so like this:


SELECT *
INTO EmptyEmployees
FROM Employees
WHERE 1 = 0;
Result: This creates a new table named EmptyEmployees with the same schema as the Employees table but with no data. 1 is never = 0 so no data will be added.



INSERT INTO
The INSERT INTO SELECT statement allows you to take existing data from one table (the source table) and insert it into another table (the target table).

The INSERT INTO SELECT statement adds new records to the target table but does not affect the existing records.
It merely appends the new data to the end of the table.

Syntax

INSERT INTO target_table (column1, column2, ...)
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM source_table
WHERE condition;


Example
Let’s consider two tables: Employees and ArchivedEmployees. We want to move employees who have left the 
company from the Employees table to the ArchivedEmployees table.

EmployeeID	EmployeeName	Department	Status
1	Alice Johnson	HR	Active
2	Bob Smith	IT	Inactive
3	Charlie Brown	Finance	Active
Structure of ArchivedEmployees Table
EmployeeID	EmployeeName	Department	Status
4	David Wilson	IT	Inactive

INSERT INTO ArchivedEmployees (EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Department, Status)
SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Department, Status
FROM Employees
WHERE Status = 'Inactive';

Result
After executing the above SQL statement, the ArchivedEmployees table will be updated as follows:

EmployeeID	EmployeeName	Department	Status
4	David Wilson	IT	Inactive
2	Bob Smith	IT	Inactive


Copy "Suppliers" into "Customers" (the columns that are not filled with data, will contain NULL):

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, City, Country)
SELECT SupplierName, City, Country FROM Suppliers;



The SQL CASE Expression
The CASE expression goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement). So,
once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.

If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.

CASE Syntax
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END;


SELECT OrderID, Quantity,
CASE
    WHEN Quantity > 30 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 30'
    WHEN Quantity = 30 THEN 'The quantity is 30'
    ELSE 'The quantity is under 30'
END AS QuantityText
FROM OrderDetails;

SELECT CustomerName, City, Country
FROM Customers
ORDER BY
(CASE
    WHEN City IS NULL THEN Country
    ELSE City
END);


SQL Null Handling Functions: IFNULL(), ISNULL(), COALESCE(), and NVL()
These functions are used in SQL to handle NULL values and return alternative values when expressions are NULL. Here's a brief overview with an example using a "Products" table.

Example Products Table
P_Id	ProductName	UnitPrice	UnitsInStock	UnitsOnOrder
1	Jarlsberg	10.45	16	15
2	Mascarpone	32.56	23	NULL
3	Gorgonzola	15.67	9	20


When calculating the total value of stock (using the formula UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + UnitsOnOrder)), a NULL value in the "UnitsOnOrder" column will result in a NULL total.
Solutions
MySQL: Using IFNULL():

In the expression IFNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0), the 0 serves as the alternative value that will be returned if UnitsOnOrder is NULL
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + IFNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0)) AS TotalValue
FROM Products;

Using COALESCE():
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0)) AS TotalValue
FROM Products;

SQL Server: Using ISNULL():
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + ISNULL(UnitsOnOrder, 0)) AS TotalValue
FROM Products;

Using COALESCE():
SELECT ProductName, UnitPrice * (UnitsInStock + COALESCE(UnitsOnOrder, 0)) AS TotalValue
FROM Products;


Single line comments start with --.
Any text between -- and the end of the line will be ignored (will not be executed).
The following example uses a single-line comment as an explanation:

Example:
-- Select all:
SELECT * FROM Customers;
eg: SELECT * FROM Customers -- WHERE City='Berlin';


Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

Any text between /* and */ will be ignored.
The following example uses a multi-line comment as an explanation:

Example
/*Select all the columns
of all the records
in the Customers table:*/
SELECT * FROM Customers;

**************************


The MySQL CREATE DATABASE Statement
The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new SQL database.

Syntax: CREATE DATABASE databasename;
eg: CREATE DATABASE testDB;

Tip: Make sure you have admin privilege before creating any database. Once a database is created, you can check it 
in the list of databases with the following SQL command: SHOW DATABASES;


The MySQL DROP DATABASE Statement
The DROP DATABASE statement is used to drop an existing SQL database.

Syntax: DROP DATABASE databasename;
eg: DROP DATABASE testDB;


The MySQL CREATE TABLE Statement
The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in a database.

Syntax: CREATE TABLE table_name (
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype,
   ....
);
eg: CREATE TABLE Persons (
    PersonID int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Address varchar(255),
    City varchar(255)
);
The column parameters specify the names of the columns of the table.
The datatype parameter specifies the type of data the column can hold (e.g. varchar, integer, date, etc.).


Create Table Using Another Table
A copy of an existing table can also be created using CREATE TABLE.

The new table gets the same column definitions. All columns or specific columns can be selected.
If you create a new table using an existing table, the new table will be filled with the existing values from the old table.

Syntax: CREATE TABLE new_table_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2,...
    FROM existing_table_name
    WHERE ....;
The following SQL creates a new table called "TestTables" (which is a copy of the "Customers" table): 
eg: CREATE TABLE TestTable AS
SELECT customername, contactname
FROM customers;


The MySQL DROP TABLE Statement
The DROP TABLE statement is used to drop an existing table in a database.
Syntax: DROP TABLE table_name;
eg: DROP TABLE Shippers;


MySQL TRUNCATE TABLE
The TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to delete the data inside a table, but not the table itself.
Syntax: 
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;


MySQL ALTER TABLE Statement
The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
The ALTER TABLE statement is also used to add and drop various constraints on an existing table.

To add a column in a table, use the following syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name
ADD column_name datatype;
The following SQL adds an "Email" column to the "Customers" table:
Example: ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD Email varchar(255);


ALTER TABLE - DROP COLUMN
To delete a column in a table, use the following syntax (notice that some database systems don't allow deleting a column):
Syntax: ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP COLUMN column_name;
The following SQL deletes the "Email" column from the "Customers" table:
Example: ALTER TABLE Customers
DROP COLUMN Email;


ALTER TABLE - MODIFY COLUMN
To change the data type of a column in a table, use the following syntax:
Sytax: ALTER TABLE table_name
MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;
eg: ALTER TABLE Persons
MODIFY  COLUMN DateOfBirth YEAR;


Create Constraints
Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.

SQL constraints are used to specify rules for the data in a table.
Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability 
of the data in the table. If there is any violation between the constraint and the data action, the action is aborted.
Constraints can be column level or table level. Column level constraints apply to a column, and table level constraints apply to the whole table.

The following constraints are commonly used in SQL:
NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table
FOREIGN KEY - Prevents actions that would destroy links between tables
CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
CREATE INDEX - Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly



MySQL NOT NULL Constraint
By default, a column can hold NULL values.
The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values.
This enforces a field to always contain a value, which means that you cannot insert a new record, or
update a record without adding a value to this field.

Ex: CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    Age int
);

NOT NULL on ALTER TABLE
To create a NOT NULL constraint on the "Age" column when the "Persons" table is already created, use the following SQL:
Example
ALTER TABLE Persons
MODIFY Age int NOT NULL;


MySQL UNIQUE Constraint
The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.
Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.
A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.
****However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, but only one PRIMARY KEY constraint per table.***

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    UNIQUE (ID)
);

To name a UNIQUE constraint, and to define a UNIQUE constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT UC_Person UNIQUE (ID,LastName)
);

Uses CONSTRAINT UC_Person UNIQUE (ID, LastName), where UC_Person is the constraint name.
Ensures that each (ID, LastName) combination is unique.
You explicitly name the constraint (UC_Person), making it easier to reference in error messages or when modifying the table later.

(or)
If you need a combination of columns to be unique, you can use a composite unique constraint.

CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    ProductID INT,
    OrderDate DATE,
    UNIQUE (CustomerID, ProductID) -- Ensures no duplicate product orders per customer
);

Defines a composite unique constraint on (CustomerID, ProductID), ensuring no customer orders the same product more than once.
Unlike the first example, this constraint is unnamed, meaning the database will automatically generate a constraint name.
Functionally, it works the same as the first example, but you won’t have a custom constraint name like UC_Person.


Adding a Unique Constraint to an Existing Table
If you forgot to add a unique constraint during table creation, you can add it later.
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD CONSTRAINT UQ_Employees_Email UNIQUE (Email);

ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD UNIQUE (ID);

DROP a UNIQUE Constraint
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP INDEX UC_Person;


MySQL PRIMARY KEY Constraint
The PRIMARY KEY constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.
Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.
A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

To allow naming of a PRIMARY KEY constraint, and for defining a PRIMARY KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName)
);

PRIMARY KEY on ALTER TABLE
ex:ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID);
ex:ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName);

DROP a PRIMARY KEY Constraint
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP PRIMARY KEY;


BOTH COMPSOTE PK AND UNIQUE DOES THE SAME THINGY, ITS JUST IT ALLOWS NULL IN UNIQUE.
Use Composite PRIMARY KEY when:
The columns together define the row uniquely.
You need to enforce strict non-nullable uniqueness.
Example: (OrderID, ProductID), (StudentID, CourseID), (MatchID, PlayerID).

Use Composite UNIQUE Constraint when:
You need to ensure uniqueness but allow NULLs.
It's not the primary way of identifying records.
Example: (DepartmentID, Email), (Country, PhoneNumber), (Username, WebsiteID).





MySQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint
The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.
A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.

Look at the following two tables:
Persons Table
PersonID	LastName	FirstName	Age
1	Hansen	Ola	30
2	Svendson	Tove	23
3	Pettersen	Kari	20

Orders Table
OrderID	OrderNumber	PersonID
1	77895	3
2	44678	3
3	22456	2
4	24562	1

Notice that the "PersonID" column in the "Orders" table points to the "PersonID" column in the "Persons" table.
The "PersonID" column in the "Persons" table is the PRIMARY KEY in the "Persons" table.
The "PersonID" column in the "Orders" table is a FOREIGN KEY in the "Orders" table.
The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because
it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.


FOREIGN KEY on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL creates a FOREIGN KEY on the "PersonID" column when the "Orders" table is created:
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
To allow naming of a FOREIGN KEY constraint, and for defining a FOREIGN KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    OrderID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    PersonID int,
    PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
    CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder FOREIGN KEY (PersonID)
    REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);


FOREIGN KEY on ALTER TABLE
To create a FOREIGN KEY constraint on the "PersonID" column when the "Orders" table is already created, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID);

To allow naming of a FOREIGN KEY constraint, and for defining a FOREIGN KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder
FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID);


DROP a FOREIGN KEY Constraint
To drop a FOREIGN KEY constraint, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Orders
DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_PersonOrder;



MySQL CHECK Constraint
The CHECK constraint is used to limit the value range that can be placed in a column.
If you define a CHECK constraint on a column it will allow only certain values for this column.
If you define a CHECK constraint on a table it can limit the values in certain columns based on values in other columns in the row.

CHECK on CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CHECK (Age>=18)
);

To allow naming of a CHECK constraint, and for defining a CHECK constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    City varchar(255),
    CONSTRAINT CHK_Person CHECK (Age>=18 AND City='Sandnes')
);

CHECK on ALTER TABLE
To create a CHECK constraint on the "Age" column when the table is already created, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CHECK (Age>=18);

To allow naming of a CHECK constraint, and for defining a CHECK constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_PersonAge CHECK (Age>=18 AND City='Sandnes');

DROP a CHECK Constraint
To drop a CHECK constraint, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
DROP CHECK CHK_PersonAge;



MySQL DEFAULT Constraint
The DEFAULT constraint is used to set a default value for a column.
The default value will be added to all new records, if no other value is specified.

DEFAULT on CREATE TABLE
The following SQL sets a DEFAULT value for the "City" column when the "Persons" table is created:
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    City varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Sandnes'
);

The DEFAULT constraint can also be used to insert system values, by using functions like CURRENT_DATE():
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
    OrderDate date DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE()
);

DEFAULT on ALTER TABLE
To create a DEFAULT constraint on the "City" column when the table is already created, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER City SET DEFAULT 'Sandnes';

DROP a DEFAULT Constraint
To drop a DEFAULT constraint, use the following SQL:
ALTER TABLE Persons
ALTER City DROP DEFAULT;


MySQL CREATE INDEX Statement
The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in tables.
Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. The users
cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries.
Note: Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes also need an update).
So, only create indexes on columns that will be frequently searched against.


CREATE INDEX Syntax
Creates an index on a table. Duplicate values are allowed:
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX Syntax
Creates a unique index on a table. Duplicate values are not allowed:
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);

MySQL CREATE INDEX Example
The SQL statement below creates an index named "idx_lastname" on the "LastName" column in the "Persons" table:
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname
ON Persons (LastName);

If you want to create an index on a combination of columns, you can list the column names within the parentheses, separated by commas:
CREATE INDEX idx_pname
ON Persons (LastName, FirstName);


DROP INDEX Statement
The DROP INDEX statement is used to delete an index in a table.
ALTER TABLE table_name
DROP INDEX index_name;

EX:

Example: Creating an Index on a Table
Let’s say you have a table called Employees with the following structure:

EmployeeID	FirstName	LastName	Department	Salary
1	John	Doe	HR	50000
2	Jane	Smith	IT	60000
3	Michael	Johnson	IT	55000
4	Emma	Williams	Marketing	45000
5	Daniel	Brown	HR	52000

Creating an Index on Department and Salary
CREATE INDEX idx_department_salary
ON Employees (Department, Salary);

What Does This Do?
Creates an index called idx_department_salary on the Employees table.
The index is created on the Department and Salary columns.
This index will speed up queries that filter on both Department and Salary columns.

How It Helps?
When you run a query like:
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT' AND Salary > 50000;
The database will use the index idx_department_salary to quickly find the rows that match both the Department and Salary conditions instead of scanning the entire table.


MySQL AUTO_INCREMENT Keyword
MySQL uses the AUTO_INCREMENT keyword to perform an auto-increment feature.
By default, the starting value for AUTO_INCREMENT is 1, and it will increment by 1 for each new record.
The following SQL statement defines the "Personid" column to be an auto-increment primary key field in the "Persons" table:

CREATE TABLE Persons (
    Personid int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (Personid)
);

To let the AUTO_INCREMENT sequence start with another value, use the following SQL statement:
ALTER TABLE Persons AUTO_INCREMENT=100;
When we insert a new record into the "Persons" table, we do NOT have to specify a value for
the "Personid" column (a unique value will be added automatically):

INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName)
VALUES ('Lars','Monsen');



MySQL Date Data Types
MySQL comes with the following data types for storing a date or a date/time value in the database:
DATE - format YYYY-MM-DD
DATETIME - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
TIMESTAMP - format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS
YEAR - format YYYY or YY
Note: The date data type are set for a column when you create a new table in your database!

Working with Dates
Look at the following table:

OrderId	ProductName	OrderDate
1	Geitost	2008-11-11
2	Camembert Pierrot	2008-11-09
3	Mozzarella di Giovanni	2008-11-11
4	Mascarpone Fabioli	2008-10-29

Now we want to select the records with an OrderDate of "2008-11-11" from the table above.

We use the following SELECT statement:
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate='2008-11-11'



View
A view is essentially a virtual table. It is not a physical table but rather a stored query that you can treat 
like a table. When you query a view, the SQL engine runs the underlying query and presents the result as if it were a table.

Fields in a view can come from one or more real tables.
Views can also include SQL functions and allow complex logic in a simpler, reusable form.

Example 1: Create a View for Customers from Brazil
Let’s create a view that shows customers only from Brazil:

CREATE VIEW Brazil_Customers AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
Here, we created a view called Brazil_Customers.

It includes the columns CustomerName and ContactName from the Customers table.
The view will only include customers where the Country is Brazil.
Now, whenever you need to see Brazilian customers, you can query the view instead of repeatedly writing the SELECT query:

SELECT * FROM Brazil_Customers;


The following SQL creates a view that selects every product in the "Products" table with a price higher than the average price:

Example: CREATE VIEW [Products Above Average Price] AS
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price > (SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products);

We can query the view above as follows: Example:
SELECT * FROM [Products Above Average Price];


CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW Syntax
The following SQL adds the "City" column to the "Brazil Customers" view:
Example: CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName, City
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

MySQL Dropping a View
A view is deleted with the DROP VIEW statement.
DROP VIEW view_name;

The following SQL drops the "Brazil Customers" view:
DROP VIEW [Brazil Customers];
